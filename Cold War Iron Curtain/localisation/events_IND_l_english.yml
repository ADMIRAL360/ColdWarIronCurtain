The People's Republic of India has claimed victory in their revolutionary war against the Republic of India. The PRI leadership has said they have liberated the country from the princes and corrupt Republican Indian leaders that took from rightful commoners. The last of Republic of India forces and people have crossed into neighboring Pakistan or Burma and also left to Ceylon. NATO has called this a failure and a setback in the South Asia region. Cominform is calling this a success for opening up the doors to South Asia and the Middle East for liberation and revolution. The fighting has ended in India, but the exiled Indians have claimed that the fight is not over."

  India_Emergency.21.d:0 "The Indian Parliament passed the thirty ninth amendment, making it the second amendment passed since the Emergency was declared. The new law places judicial restrictions on its ability to investigate the position of Prime Minister. It essentially makes the electoral fraud case being brought against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi invalid. The government argues the new law will ensure the judiciary cannot interfere in the governance of the nation by invalidating politicians on superficial charges. The opposition decried the decision, noting this is just the latest in a series of amendments passed since 1970 that have dramatically weakened the power of the judiciary."
