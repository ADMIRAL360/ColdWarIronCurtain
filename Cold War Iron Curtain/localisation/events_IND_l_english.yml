 india.7.t:0 "People's Republic of India Established!"
 india.7.d:0 "Today in Delhi, the flag of the People's Republic of India was raised and the Republic of India flag lowered. The People's Republic of India has claimed victory in their revolutionary war against the Republic of India. The PRI leadership has said they have liberated the country from the princes and corrupt Republican Indian leaders that took from rightful commoners. The last of Republic of India forces and people have crossed into neighboring Pakistan or Burma and also left to Ceylon. NATO has called this a failure and a setback in the South Asia region. Cominform is calling this a success for opening up the doors to South Asia and the Middle East for liberation and revolution. The fighting has ended in India, but the exiled Indians have claimed that the fight is not over."
 india.7.a:0 "What will happen to India now?"
 india.8.t:0 "Communist Rebellion Fails in India!"
 india.8.d:0 "The last rebel forces in the state of Hyderabad have been found in the mountains and surrendered. The People's Republic of India has surrendered in Hyderabad after the last of their forces were hunted down by the Indian Army. India has instituted a occupation force to make sure any last forces are wiped out. The Republic of India has called this a great victory in their country."
 india.8.a:0 "Interesting"
 India_Emergency.21.d:0 "The Indian Parliament passed the thirty ninth amendment, making it the second amendment passed since the Emergency was declared. The new law places judicial restrictions on its ability to investigate the position of Prime Minister. It essentially makes the electoral fraud case being brought against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi invalid. The government argues the new law will ensure the judiciary cannot interfere in the governance of the nation by invalidating politicians on superficial charges. The opposition decried the decision, noting this is just the latest in a series of amendments passed since 1970 that have dramatically weakened the power of the judiciary."

 Srikakulum.1.d:0 "In recent weeks, tensions in Srikakulam escalated after two pro-peasant communist members were murdered, allegedly by a group of landlords. In response, communist activists rallied peasant tribal people to join them in seizing land and food from the landlords. The bands of peasants are cultivating lands held for decades by local elites but unused. So far efforts by local authorities to negotiate a resolution and reduce the tensions has failed. The local authorities told the media they may soon deploy the police and stop criminal acts from spreading across the region and condemned activists for misleading peasants for their own nefarious agendas."
 Srikakulum.2.d:0 "The peasant unrest in Srikakulum recently escalated to peasant raids targeting landlords. The raids occurred following the alleged murder of communist activists by the landlords. Regardless, the law and order situation rapidly declined, forcing the local police to be deployed. The police operations have largely failed, their raids are ineffective and rebel peasants successfully stormed several police posts, causing officers to flee. Of a larger concern are recent massive raids by the peasant fighters. In one instance, several hundred peasants stormed the property of one landlord, stealing food and tens of thousands of rupees worth of goods. Only weeks later, another mass of rebel peasants assaulted a village and its local police, numbering several hundred, the officers were forced to flee after taking heavy losses. With the situation escalating, the Indian government announced it would deploy paramilitary forces to the region."
 Srikakulum.3.d:0 "The situation in Srikakulum has largely been restored following the deployment of paramilitary forces. These troops led by competent officers and far better equipped than the peasant forcers were able to disperse rebel bands and force many of the peasants to abandon their armed resistance. Several communist leaders were also killed in raids by the security forces, greatly weakening the organization of the peasants. The military has drastically reduced operations and lifted emergency restrictions as it appears most peasants have abandoned the armed resistance and surviving communist leaders are underground. The writ of law and order appears to be returning to India, but these agitators of rural peasants are still hiding amongst the people."

 INC_60s.1.d:0 "The Indian National Congress Party has been on the forefront of freedom and progress since its foundation in 1885. It was Congress who led the freedom struggle and helped forge a united India built on ideas of secularism, equality, and democracy. However, the party has a wide variety of perspectives and views within it. The Prime Minister in recent months has noticed a schism beginning to form with the more leftist wing of the party and the more right-wing faction. The leftists continue to advocate for socialist policies and the promotion of wealth equality. However, the right, led by Moraji Desai bemoans the shift towards what they see is a foreign socialist ideology and an inability to promote traditional Gandhian values. They also believe the government should support responsible business communities to promote the Indian economy."
 INC_60s.2.d:0 "Efforts by the Prime Minister to negotiate support with the two wings of the Congress Party ended in disaster following a ruling made by the party leadership to expel Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from the party. The Prime Minister is accused of violating party discipline and many believe this is a result of her active support of more leftist policies. In response, Indira Gandhi announced she would form her own faction of the India National Congress made of her supporters and maintain her government through a coalition. The remaining India National Congress members have organized under the leadership of Moraji Desai, a famed freedom fighter and champion of the values espoused by Mahatma Gandhi. He pledged his party would not follow foreign ideologies but instead strengthen the economy and champion the society envisioned by the Mahatma."

 Smiling_Buddha.1.d:0 "The Indian Prime Minister secretly directed the Bhabha Atomic Research Center to begin preparations for assembling and producing a nuclear device for a test. The preparations were completed, and last night India detonated a nuclear device. The Indian government confirmed the detonation, code-named Smiling Buddha, and called it a peaceful nuclear test. The current international and regional climate necessitates India assert its position. The nuclear bomb is the most powerful weapon on the planet and demonstrating our possession of it will put India in elite company. The Prime Minister kept strict control over information related to the test and its preparations, which is why much of the Indian government, people, and even military were caught off-guard by the news. The public reaction has largely been positive as Indians now see themselves as among the global elite and the premier power of the region."
 Smiling_Buddha.2.d:0 "The Indian government confirmed it had detonated a nuclear device recently in an operation it called ‘Smiling Buddha’. The explosion, conducted underground caught the world by surprise and its detonation was felt as far as Islamabad. The Indian media and much of its government expressed its surprise but joy at the news of India joining the elite Nuclear Club. Pakistan was quick to condemn the Indian test as a provocation and escalation, while vowing to not be cowed into silence. Despite these defiant words, the Indian government appears unfazed and insisted the test was not military in nature and purely represented a major scientific achievement for India. The other major powers have remained largely quiet, but the United States is expected to make a statement soon."
 Smiling_Buddha.3.d:0 "India recently detonated a nuclear device, making it a new nuclear power. The Indian government insists the test was purely scientific and not military. Our own intelligence sources conclude that the Indian military was largely excluded from the planning of the test, though its senior officers were updated on the preparation and progress of the test. India will certainly build a nuclear arsenal, at the very least to act as a deterrence. The test upsets any balance of power in South Asia and we fear other states, especially Pakistan, may also seek to advance their nuclear capabilities. We have two ways to respond, we can sanction India for bringing nuclear weapons into the region without any warning, or we could simply express concerns to the Indians. Our own domestic population does not seem too bothered by the test, but providing sanctions would boost ties with Pakistan."

 IND_BENGAL.1.d:0 "The Pakistan Army recently launched a crackdown in East Pakistan. Their brutal violence has escalated the situation and resulted in a growing refugee crisis. Pakistanis, especially Hindus, are fleeing to Calcutta from East Pakistan. They are bringing stories of atrocities and brutal repression. The international media is covering the situation while local authorities are setting up emergency refugee camps. Reports from the border suggest the number of refugees will likely reach the millions. The federal government will step in to help local authorities. Considering the number of refugees and the resources we will require to host them we can expect the economy to be negatively impacted. There are also fears that tensions will rise between our population and the refugees. Regardless, the people of India must rise to the occasion and help the Bengalis suffering under military repression."
 IND_BENGAL.2.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested we act to help resolve the situation in East Pakistan. The Indians are pointing to the rising refugee crisis in Calcutta and the widely reported news of a brutal Pakistani military crackdown. The Indians suggest if a solution cannot be found, they may be forced to act and resolve the situation themselves. We have historically close ties with Pakistan and the State Department suggests we can put pressure on them. Our national media is widely reporting on the Pakistani crackdown and there is growing agitation for us to act and end the violence. However, the Pakistanis would likely view any effort by us negatively and it is generally not our policy to not intervene in the internal affairs of friendly states at the behest of other states."
 IND_BENGAL.3.d:0 "The United States recently dispatched a diplomatic delegation to Pakistan and urged its government to halt its ongoing military operations in East Pakistan. The Pakistani government publicly stated it appreciated American interest but privately reports indicate they are furious. The American effort is not likely to cause Pakistan to change its approach to the situation, but it indicates the rising international isolation Pakistan is facing with its ongoing operations. The Indian government released a statement in support of the American effort, fueling media reports in Pakistan accusing America and India colluding against the nation."
 IND_BENGAL.4.d:0 "The Indian government recently dispatched an emergency delegation to hold talks with us over the ongoing crisis in East Pakistan. The Indians expressed fears that if the situation deteriorated further it could lead to catastrophe across the region. They urged us to implement the Ahsan Formula as the best solution to end the crisis in a peaceful and honorable way. This was done privately as the Indians did not want to make it seem like they were forcing our hand and to give us political cover, which is appreciated. Senior military leaders and hawks are urging the President to reject what they see is Indian hegemony. However, some cabinet members believe the Ahsan Formula remains the best solution and we should implement it as soon as possible."
 IND_BENGAL.5.d:0 "We received a troubling ultimatum from the Indian government calling for us to immediately halt military operations and withdraw from so-called Bangladesh. The Indians call the operations a humanitarian crisis and incubator of human rights abuses that will boil over and lead to catastrophe across the region. They are giving us three months to implement the withdrawal, stating that a failure to do so may result in India taking whatever actions are necessary to end the violence. There are many who feel India is just blustering and have no intention of involving themselves militarily. Some other leaders believe even if India intervenes, the Pakistan nation is more than ready to offer a befitting reply. Privately, a few officials are urging the President to accept the ultimatum and cut our losses in East Pakistan. They say the sting of a withdrawal is much preferred to what they fear may end up being a military disaster."
