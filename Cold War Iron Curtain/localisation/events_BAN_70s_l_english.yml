 BAN_FOR.1.d:0 "An intermediary nation brought a message from Bangladesh. They are asking for a normalization in our relations. Up to this point, we remained steadfast in supporting Pakistan by not engaging with the new state. However, the international situation is such we cannot ignore a new Asian state. Pakistan appreciates our support but will not hold it against us for opening ties. Bangladesh is strategically located along the Bay of Bengal and on the eastern border of India. It could potentially be a strong ally for us. We have two options, one is to establish friendly diplomatic relations, this will likely not hurt the feelings of Pakistan. The other option is to offer a trade and military aid pact to show our interest in a strategic partnership, this will likely annoy Pakistan."
 BAN_FOR.2.d:0 "The Chinese government agreed to establish full diplomatic relations with us. The former Chinese consulate in Dacca will be upgraded to a full embassy, a new ambassador is expected to be announced soon. We have also been invited to establish an embassy in Beijing. China remains a vital Asian power and establishing close ties will help ensure we are never completely dependent on India in the future. This is a major boost for our foreign policy and gives our people greater legitimacy internationally."
 BAN_FOR.3.d:0 "The Chinese government responded very positively to our call for diplomatic normalization. They have offered a pact to provide favorable trade terms and military aid. The proposed aid could help equip several infantry battalions with small arms. Our top military and economic leaders are very attracted to the proposal. However, top political and diplomatic experts note if we accept this support, we will alienate India. The Indians will not look kindly to an increased Chinese presence in our land. Instead, they believe we should appreciate the offer but stick to maintaining friendly ties. We must decide if the military aid and economic support is worth alienating our largest neighbor."
 BAN_FOR.4.d:0 "The newly independent state of Bangladesh recently requested we send experts to boost their economy and military. The government espouses a desire to adopt a socialist economic model to elevate its impoverished people. Our analysis note that although the government and its supporters support socialism, there are many Bangladeshis who have reservations. Especially within the military and among the conservative elements. Our aid could help the government achieve success and increasingly convince the population to eventually embrace a total socialist society. However, some of reports suggest the country is too undeveloped economically or socially to make our aid effective. It may be better to just focus on boosting ties. A decision will need to be made."
 BAN_FOR.5.d:0 "The government and media recently welcomed the arrival of Soviet experts to Dacca. More advisors are expected in the coming weeks as the advisory committee organizes itself in the country. We welcome these advisors offering support for the Finance and Defence Ministries. Socialism offers the cure for Bangladeshi poverty and class divisions. The Soviet experts will enjoy our full cooperation. The military has refused permission for any Soviet experts to visit or embed with any military headquarters or field units. They are citing security concerns, but over time we hope the more reactionary officers can be replaced."
 BAN_FOR.6.d:0 "The Bangladesh government privately reached out to ask for their share in federal assets. The Bangladeshis claim their province provided extensive financial support to the federal government and would like those remaining assets returned immediately. The situation puts us in an awkward situation. The Finance Ministry has the records and believes the government could return those specific assets collected from the former East Pakistan. Considering how they left the country, many in the cabinet would rather we do not give a cent. Others argue a portion could be returned, this would help our relations. Finally, we could return all the assets, which would go a long way to strengthen ties."
 BAN_FOR.7.d:0 "We recently requested the Pakistan government return those assets and capital held by the federal government from our provincial contributions to the center. We were not expecting a positive Pakistani response but were pleasantly surprised. The Pakistanis signed an agreement promising to return the assets over the next two years. This will boost our economy and help stabilize our own growth. However, the value of the assets appears to be only a small percentage of what is owed. The Pakistanis insist their offer cannot be increased. Regardless, it is significant they have agreed to give anything and will help our ties."
 BAN_FOR.8.d:0 "We recently requested the Pakistan government return those assets and capital held by the federal government from our provincial contributions to the center. We were not expecting a positive Pakistani response but were greatly surprised. The Pakistanis signed an agreement promising to return the assets over the next five years. This will boost our economy and stabilize our growth. The value offered by the Pakistanis matches our own calculations, it appears the Pakistanis are genuinely interested and willing to return the assets. This is a significant development and perhaps indicates a future of cooperation and brotherhood between our states."
 BAN_FOR.9.d:0 "Our ambassador in Dacca received a request from the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh. The Minister called for our two nations to hold talks to demarcate the border. Currently, there are many enclaves within both our territories and the population in the borderlands finds the situation problematic. Resolving the border would potentially strengthen ties and make the border less chaotic for its residents. However, our experts note a number of our enclaves are essentially surrounded by Bangladesh. A demarcation could see us lose villages and citizens to Bangladesh. If that is a potential we can accept, than talks can occur, if not, we should politely decline the talks."
 BAN_FOR.10.d:0 "The Indian government has agreed to hold talks in Calcutta over our border. We are currently assembling a high-powered team and need to develop a negotiating strategy. The Indians indicated they want to hear our solutions to the issue and negotiate from there. One proposal we developed calls for both sides to cede the enclaves on the border to one another. This would change the national ownership of the enclave villages. Its residents could either stay and be given their new citizenship or repatriate. The other proposal would solidify the borders but require a population transfer. All Bangladeshis in enclaves taken by India would be returned and vice versa. The villagers would have no choice in this solution. We must decide what position to propose."
 BAN_FOR.11.d:0 "We are holding talks with Bangladesh in Calcutta over our border. In particular, there is concern with regards to enclave villages held by both sides. The Bangladeshis proposed both sides cede those enclaves surrounded by the other power. The villagers will then be given the option to either take citizenship of their new nation or be repatriated. The Bangladeshis insists this will stabilize the border while providing villagers an option. Our own negotiators believe the agreement may help stabilize the border but gives only the illusion of choice to the villagers. Noting those who wish to retain their Indian citizenship would have to abandon home. This would put pressure on the local authorities to resettle those citizens, who may not be worth the headache. However, the negotiators also concede the agreement would end the enclave headache that has plagued the borderland since Partition."
 BAN_FOR.12.d:0 "We are holding talks with Bangladesh in Calcutta over our border. In particular, there is concern with regards to enclave villages held by both sides. The Bangladeshis proposed both sides cede those enclaves surrounded by the other power. However, they insist all residents in the enclaves be transferred, meaning our citizens in our enclaves would be transferred to us. We would also return Bangladeshi citizens back from their enclaves in India. This proposal would decisively resolve the issue, however, our negotiators have concerns. We have far more citizens who would be forcibly deported from their ancestral homes. This will likely raise tensions and put pressure on local authorities to resettle the refugees. The government should decide a response."
 BAN_FOR.13.d:0 "Border talks in Calcutta between Bangladesh and India failed to resolve tensions. Currently, there are hundreds of enclaves on both sides of the border and extensive confusion, coupled with occasional border clashes. The Bangladeshis were keen on resolving the issue of the enclaves. However, the Indians were more interested in the enclave residents. The Indian government insists any solution to the enclaves should offer the opportunity for residents to keep their national identity and access to ancestral lands. The Bangladeshi government views this as unrealistic. Despite the failure, both sides agreed to continue positive discussions on all outstanding issues."
 
 BAN_ECON.1.d:0 "The people of Bangladesh deserve peace and prosperity. Our people were victims of colonial exploitation for centuries and now control their own destiny. The government recently received two proposed five-year plans. One, developed by leading political leaders and academics envisions a nation transitioning to socialism. This plan offers an ambitious effort to provide dynamic thinking for the growth of society. The other plan, developed by the traditional bureaucratic institutions, offers a more modest series of reforms, meant to transition Bangladesh into a stable, independent economy. Many in the government favor the academic plan as it offers a new approach to economic development and breaks from the traditional mechanisms. However, too rapid a change could cause problems for the fledging state."
 BAN_ECON.2.d:0 "Jute remains one of the most vital industries in Bangladesh and historically a source of our exploitation. The British and then Pakistanis ran the jute mills, draining the wealth from the nation. With independence, many of these jute mills are sitting inactive. Some recommended the government auction these industries to private businesses and corporations. However, this would only encourage a new wave of exploitation. The government will begin the process of nationalizing these jute mills and bring them into operation. The workers and mills are now under the control of the Bangladesh Jute Mill."
 BAN_ECON.3.d:0 "A recent report notes jute production in the country is far lower than during the pre-independence period. Expenses at the mill are also far higher. The unions are being accused of providing excessive difficulties to the administrators. The administration also faced stinging criticism in the report. Its members are accused of absenteeism and being unqualified. Many members of the Bangladesh Jute Board are political appointees with little to know knowledge of the industry. Despite these major setbacks, the government insists it will not privatize the mills, though it has promised reforms to curb inefficiencies. There are plans to end the Bangladesh Jute Board and place it under the Finance Ministry."
 BAN_ECON.4.d:0 "A committee of economists and senior civil service officials recently published a report after investigating the government-run Bangladesh Jute Board. They noted efforts at reforming inefficiencies have been ineffective. Unions remain difficult to manage, especially with an administration staffed by members with little experience in business or the jute industry. The recent reform of creating a separate Jute Ministry to cut costs has had little impact. The report recommends the government begins privatizing the mills which are a drain on the finances of the country. However, the years of commitment towards state control means complete privatization is not possible. The government plans on slowly privatizing some jute mills to assess the situation."
 BAN_ECON.5.d:0 "Following recommendations from an expert committee, the government recently privatized around a dozen jute mills. In addition, the government initiated several incentives to spur growth. However, a recent assessment concludes the private jute mills are producing at the same or only slightly higher than government run mills. This is disappointing news for the economy, though the report gives more ammunition to those advocating the government not give up its stake in the industry completely. The government said it will curtail the pace of privatization but continue to provide incentives and subsidies to the industry."
 BAN_ECON.10.d:0 "The Finance Ministry released a series of regulations to codify industrial relations between the management and workers. These are meant to better lay out exactly what legal recourse both sides have in regards to negotiations or declaring strikes. Worker groups are criticizing the decision, noting Bangladesh still lacks vital legislation on the issue, giving factory owners an unfair advantage. The leading business association also criticized the regulations as a roadmap to allow workers to effectively carry out protests without violating the law. Despite these criticisms, the Finance Ministry insists the decision will help resolve current conflicts and spur more legislation in the future."
 BAN_ECON.11.d:0 "Jute is a vital industry for Bangladesh. During colonial period, the jute produced in the land went to what is now India for processing. Despite the potential and promises, little has been done to build a processing capability in Bangladesh itself. To rectify this, new incentives and protections are being offered internationally to encourage foreign investment in the jute industry. Bangladesh has a potential for great growth but needs to do so with help from finance abroad. Diplomatic missions will soon begin publicizing the new opportunities."
 BAN_ECON.12.d:0 "Our efforts at encouraging foreign investment to expand jute processing facilities bore some fruit. We attracted funding from some development organizations and a few investment groups. However, this is less than we anticipated when launching the effort. It appears most people still view our nation as a risky investment. Despite this, we are able to expand some of our processing capabilities which will provide a boon for the economy. More importantly, it allows us to benefit more by exporting products produced from jute instead of just the raw material."
 BAN_ECON.13.d:0 "Our efforts at encouraging foreign investment to expand jute processing facilities bore fruit. Diplomatic missions and the Finance Ministry were bombarded with requests from investment groups and organizations interested in the proposed program. It appears our nation is seen by many as a land of opportunity. We are able to not just greatly expand the processing of jute in the country but also have attracted enough foreign partners to maximize profit opportunities. This is a major success for the people of Bangladesh."
 BAN_ECON.14.d:0 "We are currently receiving some new interest for foreign investments in Bangladesh. The Finance Ministry believes it will be in the interest of the nation if we can focus on a specific developmental area to maximize this increase. Some experts believe we should direct this support towards building up infrastructure across the nation. Other experts see a focus on developing energy as being paramount to building a foundation for future economic growth. Some of the top political leadership insists the focus should be on new industries to provide more jobs to the people. A decision must be made soon."
 BAN_ECON.15.d:0 "The previous Pakistan regime continued to hold large tracts of land it inherited from the British regime. The military later on seized more land, ostensibly for security reasons. After an extensive survey, the government has identified large amounts of agriculturally viable land that can be returned to the peasants. It just needs to be determined how to distribute the land. One option is to redistribute the land to landless peasants. The other option calls for the public sale of these lands. Supporters of the former believe this will rectify the continued oppression of peasants in the nation. Those wanting a public sale note if someone buys the land, they will likely put in the investment necessary to make it worthwhile."
 BAN_ECON.16.d:0 "Our peasants are infuriated by the decision to publicly sell-off excess government lands. They argue this land should have been returned to the people who desperately need it. Many peasant families claim they have virtually no opportunity to gain land are increasingly being coerced to work under landlords. Certain officials are being accused of massively profiting from the sales. There are increasing incidents of peasants refusing to work or reducing the amount of work put in to protest what they see as a dire situation."
