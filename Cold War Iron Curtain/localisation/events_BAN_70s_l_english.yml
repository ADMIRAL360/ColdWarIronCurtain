 BAN_FOR.1.d:0 "An intermediary nation brought a message from Bangladesh. They are asking for a normalization in our relations. Up to this point, we remained steadfast in supporting Pakistan by not engaging with the new state. However, the international situation is such we cannot ignore a new Asian state. Pakistan appreciates our support but will not hold it against us for opening ties. Bangladesh is strategically located along the Bay of Bengal and on the eastern border of India. It could potentially be a strong ally for us. We have two options, one is to establish friendly diplomatic relations, this will likely not hurt the feelings of Pakistan. The other option is to offer a trade and military aid pact to show our interest in a strategic partnership, this will likely annoy Pakistan."
 BAN_FOR.2.d:0 "The Chinese government agreed to establish full diplomatic relations with us. The former Chinese consulate in Dacca will be upgraded to a full embassy, a new ambassador is expected to be announced soon. We have also been invited to establish an embassy in Beijing. China remains a vital Asian power and establishing close ties will help ensure we are never completely dependent on India in the future. This is a major boost for our foreign policy and gives our people greater legitimacy internationally."
 BAN_FOR.3.d:0 "The Chinese government responded very positively to our call for diplomatic normalization. They have offered a pact to provide favorable trade terms and military aid. The proposed aid could help equip several infantry battalions with small arms. Our top military and economic leaders are very attracted to the proposal. However, top political and diplomatic experts note if we accept this support, we will alienate India. The Indians will not look kindly to an increased Chinese presence in our land. Instead, they believe we should appreciate the offer but stick to maintaining friendly ties. We must decide if the military aid and economic support is worth alienating our largest neighbor."
 BAN_FOR.4.d:0 "The newly independent state of Bangladesh recently requested we send experts to boost their economy and military. The government espouses a desire to adopt a socialist economic model to elevate its impoverished people. Our analysis note that although the government and its supporters support socialism, there are many Bangladeshis who have reservations. Especially within the military and among the conservative elements. Our aid could help the government achieve success and increasingly convince the population to eventually embrace a total socialist society. However, some of reports suggest the country is too undeveloped economically or socially to make our aid effective. It may be better to just focus on boosting ties. A decision will need to be made."
 BAN_FOR.5.d:0 "The government and media recently welcomed the arrival of Soviet experts to Dacca. More advisors are expected in the coming weeks as the advisory committee organizes itself in the country. We welcome these advisors offering support for the Finance and Defence Ministries. Socialism offers the cure for Bangladeshi poverty and class divisions. The Soviet experts will enjoy our full cooperation. The military has refused permission for any Soviet experts to visit or embed with any military headquarters or field units. They are citing security concerns, but over time we hope the more reactionary officers can be replaced."
 BAN_FOR.6.d:0 "The Bangladesh government privately reached out to ask for their share in federal assets. The Bangladeshis claim their province provided extensive financial support to the federal government and would like those remaining assets returned immediately. The situation puts us in an awkward situation. The Finance Ministry has the records and believes the government could return those specific assets collected from the former East Pakistan. Considering how they left the country, many in the cabinet would rather we do not give a cent. Others argue a portion could be returned, this would help our relations. Finally, we could return all the assets, which would go a long way to strengthen ties."
 BAN_FOR.7.d:0 "We recently requested the Pakistan government return those assets and capital held by the federal government from our provincial contributions to the center. We were not expecting a positive Pakistani response but were pleasantly surprised. The Pakistanis signed an agreement promising to return the assets over the next two years. This will boost our economy and help stabilize our own growth. However, the value of the assets appears to be only a small percentage of what is owed. The Pakistanis insist their offer cannot be increased. Regardless, it is significant they have agreed to give anything and will help our ties."
 BAN_FOR.8.d:0 "We recently requested the Pakistan government return those assets and capital held by the federal government from our provincial contributions to the center. We were not expecting a positive Pakistani response but were greatly surprised. The Pakistanis signed an agreement promising to return the assets over the next five years. This will boost our economy and stabilize our growth. The value offered by the Pakistanis matches our own calculations, it appears the Pakistanis are genuinely interested and willing to return the assets. This is a significant development and perhaps indicates a future of cooperation and brotherhood between our states."
 BAN_FOR.9.d:0 "Our ambassador in Dacca received a request from the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh. The Minister called for our two nations to hold talks to demarcate the border. Currently, there are many enclaves within both our territories and the population in the borderlands finds the situation problematic. Resolving the border would potentially strengthen ties and make the border less chaotic for its residents. However, our experts note a number of our enclaves are essentially surrounded by Bangladesh. A demarcation could see us lose villages and citizens to Bangladesh. If that is a potential we can accept, than talks can occur, if not, we should politely decline the talks."
 BAN_FOR.10.d:0 "The Indian government has agreed to hold talks in Calcutta over our border. We are currently assembling a high-powered team and need to develop a negotiating strategy. The Indians indicated they want to hear our solutions to the issue and negotiate from there. One proposal we developed calls for both sides to cede the enclaves on the border to one another. This would change the national ownership of the enclave villages. Its residents could either stay and be given their new citizenship or repatriate. The other proposal would solidify the borders but require a population transfer. All Bangladeshis in enclaves taken by India would be returned and vice versa. The villagers would have no choice in this solution. We must decide what position to propose."
 BAN_FOR.11.d:0 "We are holding talks with Bangladesh in Calcutta over our border. In particular, there is concern with regards to enclave villages held by both sides. The Bangladeshis proposed both sides cede those enclaves surrounded by the other power. The villagers will then be given the option to either take citizenship of their new nation or be repatriated. The Bangladeshis insists this will stabilize the border while providing villagers an option. Our own negotiators believe the agreement may help stabilize the border but gives only the illusion of choice to the villagers. Noting those who wish to retain their Indian citizenship would have to abandon home. This would put pressure on the local authorities to resettle those citizens, who may not be worth the headache. However, the negotiators also concede the agreement would end the enclave headache that has plagued the borderland since Partition."
 BAN_FOR.12.d:0 "We are holding talks with Bangladesh in Calcutta over our border. In particular, there is concern with regards to enclave villages held by both sides. The Bangladeshis proposed both sides cede those enclaves surrounded by the other power. However, they insist all residents in the enclaves be transferred, meaning our citizens in our enclaves would be transferred to us. We would also return Bangladeshi citizens back from their enclaves in India. This proposal would decisively resolve the issue, however, our negotiators have concerns. We have far more citizens who would be forcibly deported from their ancestral homes. This will likely raise tensions and put pressure on local authorities to resettle the refugees. The government should decide a response."
 BAN_FOR.13.d:0 "Border talks in Calcutta between Bangladesh and India failed to resolve tensions. Currently, there are hundreds of enclaves on both sides of the border and extensive confusion, coupled with occasional border clashes. The Bangladeshis were keen on resolving the issue of the enclaves. However, the Indians were more interested in the enclave residents. The Indian government insists any solution to the enclaves should offer the opportunity for residents to keep their national identity and access to ancestral lands. The Bangladeshi government views this as unrealistic. Despite the failure, both sides agreed to continue positive discussions on all outstanding issues."
 
 BAN_ECON.1.d:0 "The people of Bangladesh deserve peace and prosperity. Our people were victims of colonial exploitation for centuries and now control their own destiny. The government recently received two proposed five-year plans. One, developed by leading political leaders and academics envisions a nation transitioning to socialism. This plan offers an ambitious effort to provide dynamic thinking for the growth of society. The other plan, developed by the traditional bureaucratic institutions, offers a more modest series of reforms, meant to transition Bangladesh into a stable, independent economy. Many in the government favor the academic plan as it offers a new approach to economic development and breaks from the traditional mechanisms. However, too rapid a change could cause problems for the fledging state."
 BAN_ECON.2.d:0 "Jute remains one of the most vital industries in Bangladesh and historically a source of our exploitation. The British and then Pakistanis ran the jute mills, draining the wealth from the nation. With independence, many of these jute mills are sitting inactive. Some recommended the government auction these industries to private businesses and corporations. However, this would only encourage a new wave of exploitation. The government will begin the process of nationalizing these jute mills and bring them into operation. The workers and mills are now under the control of the Bangladesh Jute Mill."
 BAN_ECON.3.d:0 "A recent report notes jute production in the country is far lower than during the pre-independence period. Expenses at the mill are also far higher. The unions are being accused of providing excessive difficulties to the administrators. The administration also faced stinging criticism in the report. Its members are accused of absenteeism and being unqualified. Many members of the Bangladesh Jute Board are political appointees with little to know knowledge of the industry. Despite these major setbacks, the government insists it will not privatize the mills, though it has promised reforms to curb inefficiencies. There are plans to end the Bangladesh Jute Board and place it under the Finance Ministry."
 BAN_ECON.4.d:0 "A committee of economists and senior civil service officials recently published a report after investigating the government-run Bangladesh Jute Board. They noted efforts at reforming inefficiencies have been ineffective. Unions remain difficult to manage, especially with an administration staffed by members with little experience in business or the jute industry. The recent reform of creating a separate Jute Ministry to cut costs has had little impact. The report recommends the government begins privatizing the mills which are a drain on the finances of the country. However, the years of commitment towards state control means complete privatization is not possible. The government plans on slowly privatizing some jute mills to assess the situation."
 BAN_ECON.5.d:0 "Following recommendations from an expert committee, the government recently privatized around a dozen jute mills. In addition, the government initiated several incentives to spur growth. However, a recent assessment concludes the private jute mills are producing at the same or only slightly higher than government run mills. This is disappointing news for the economy, though the report gives more ammunition to those advocating the government not give up its stake in the industry completely. The government said it will curtail the pace of privatization but continue to provide incentives and subsidies to the industry."
 BAN_ECON.10.d:0 "The Finance Ministry released a series of regulations to codify industrial relations between the management and workers. These are meant to better lay out exactly what legal recourse both sides have in regards to negotiations or declaring strikes. Worker groups are criticizing the decision, noting Bangladesh still lacks vital legislation on the issue, giving factory owners an unfair advantage. The leading business association also criticized the regulations as a roadmap to allow workers to effectively carry out protests without violating the law. Despite these criticisms, the Finance Ministry insists the decision will help resolve current conflicts and spur more legislation in the future."
 BAN_ECON.11.d:0 "Jute is a vital industry for Bangladesh. During colonial period, the jute produced in the land went to what is now India for processing. Despite the potential and promises, little has been done to build a processing capability in Bangladesh itself. To rectify this, new incentives and protections are being offered internationally to encourage foreign investment in the jute industry. Bangladesh has a potential for great growth but needs to do so with help from finance abroad. Diplomatic missions will soon begin publicizing the new opportunities."
 BAN_ECON.12.d:0 "Our efforts at encouraging foreign investment to expand jute processing facilities bore some fruit. We attracted funding from some development organizations and a few investment groups. However, this is less than we anticipated when launching the effort. It appears most people still view our nation as a risky investment. Despite this, we are able to expand some of our processing capabilities which will provide a boon for the economy. More importantly, it allows us to benefit more by exporting products produced from jute instead of just the raw material."
 BAN_ECON.13.d:0 "Our efforts at encouraging foreign investment to expand jute processing facilities bore fruit. Diplomatic missions and the Finance Ministry were bombarded with requests from investment groups and organizations interested in the proposed program. It appears our nation is seen by many as a land of opportunity. We are able to not just greatly expand the processing of jute in the country but also have attracted enough foreign partners to maximize profit opportunities. This is a major success for the people of Bangladesh."
 BAN_ECON.14.d:0 "We are currently receiving some new interest for foreign investments in Bangladesh. The Finance Ministry believes it will be in the interest of the nation if we can focus on a specific developmental area to maximize this increase. Some experts believe we should direct this support towards building up infrastructure across the nation. Other experts see a focus on developing energy as being paramount to building a foundation for future economic growth. Some of the top political leadership insists the focus should be on new industries to provide more jobs to the people. A decision must be made soon."
 BAN_ECON.15.d:0 "The previous Pakistan regime continued to hold large tracts of land it inherited from the British regime. The military later on seized more land, ostensibly for security reasons. After an extensive survey, the government has identified large amounts of agriculturally viable land that can be returned to the peasants. It just needs to be determined how to distribute the land. One option is to redistribute the land to landless peasants. The other option calls for the public sale of these lands. Supporters of the former believe this will rectify the continued oppression of peasants in the nation. Those wanting a public sale note if someone buys the land, they will likely put in the investment necessary to make it worthwhile."
 BAN_ECON.16.d:0 "Our peasants are infuriated by the decision to publicly sell-off excess government lands. They argue this land should have been returned to the people who desperately need it. Many peasant families claim they have virtually no opportunity to gain land are increasingly being coerced to work under landlords. Certain officials are being accused of massively profiting from the sales. There are increasing incidents of peasants refusing to work or reducing the amount of work put in to protest what they see as a dire situation."

 Rahman_Assasination.1.d:0 "There is chaos in Dacca following reports that armed, uniformed men stormed the residence of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. There are reports of explosions and gunfire from the residence. Bangladeshis are said to be in a state of apprehension as they try to understand what is occurring. The recent uptake in violence, crime, and an economic crisis has greatly eroded the popularity of the President. The military in particular is said to the perturbed by these crises as it finds itself engaged in a conflict with the radical socialist JSD."
 Rahman_Assasination.2.d:0 "State media in Bangladesh confirmed that patriotic military officers were responsible for the assault on the residence of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The officers then went on the air to confirm they had killed Mujibur Rahman to save the nation. Among the confirmed dead are his two sons, who were seen as his future successors. His two daughters are in West Germany. Just several years earlier, millions cheered Mujibur Rahman as their champion, however, the reaction to his death is largely subdued. It appears the economic crisis and other domestic issues have largely depleted his standing among the people. It is unclear exactly who is now in charge of the government. The military continues to remain silent on their roll in this coup. The officers involved are of mid-level ranks and the higher ranked officers appear to be just as shocked by the coup as the people."
 Rahman_Assasination.3.d:0 "In an unprecedented development, Khondaker Mostaq Khan has proclaimed himself the new President of Bangladesh. He is a noted nationalist leader and member of the executive committee. The new leader appeared to have taken over with support from the coup leaders. Analysts believe the coup plotters believed their low ranks made them vulnerable but the new President will legitimize their action. The new President did work with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Prior to joining the executive committee, he had served as a minister for the government. Some experts believe his selection as President is meant to appease the armed wing of the Awami League and prevent either a counter-coup or foreign intervention. The people of Bangladesh are left waiting to see what the future holds for them."
 Rahman_Assasination.4.d:0 "President Khondaker Mostaq Khan took over as President after being approached by the Awami League leadership following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The new present must now decide what to do with the assassins. It is clear the assassins approved his appointment on the condition he grant them immunity. If this is not given, there is a high possibility of another, more violent coup by the heavily armed, junior officers. The other option is to take no opinion on the assassination and defer it to the military justice system. This decision will determine the destiny of the new government."
 Rahman_Assasination.5.d:0 "President Khondaker Mostaq Khan addressed the nation. He praised the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for saving the nation from destruction. He also called for national reconciliation. As part of this plan, he announced a new Indemnity Ordinance. This will give full immunity to the assassins, who are already receiving senior positions in the new government. Many Bangladeshis are said to be shocked by the decision, though there are no reports of unrest. However, the Awami League and its most die hard members will be infuriated over the lack of justice for their late leader. There are already rumors in Dacca that the new President faces a high risk of an Awami League reaction, as many wish to see Mujibur Rahman avenged."
 Rahman_Assasination.6.d:0 "If the regime of President Khondaker Mostaq Khan is to survive, the military must be brought under control. The initial coup had been launched by mid level officers, but they lack the authority or status to assert control over the military. The current Army Chief, General Shafiullah was a strong supporter of Mujibur Rahman and did not see the coup coming. If he is retained, it may maintain order, but puts the government at risk considering his political views. Many officials are recommending General Shafiullah be retired and replaced by General Ziaur Rahman. General Rahman is seen as a conservative officer, not likely to be influenced by the Mujibur Rahman loyalists. However, his is an ambitious officer, promoting him may give the military more influene over the state."
 Rahman_Assasination.7.d:0 "The late President Mujibur Rahman sought to consolidate his power through his BakSAL party. President Khondaker Mostaq Khan announced he would immediately breakup BakSAL and allow all political parties to return. He noted the one-state party left many Bangladeshis to feel disenfranchised or uninvolved with the politics of the country. Restoring political parties will bring back the rich political activism of the people and restore a more democratic character to Bangladesh. The move is being widely praised, though there are some concerns. Many politicians fear the religious parties may take advantage of this new situation and try to manipulate the electorate by playing on religious sentiments. The President dismissed these concerns and noted his belief in the compatibility of Islam and democracy."
 Rahman_Assasination.8.d:0 "Following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the ascension of President Khondaker Mostaq Khan to office, senior Awami League leaders were detained. The new President recognized his position was very precarious with regards not only to the military officers who carried out the assassination but to Mujibur loyalists in the party. These loyalists, though detained, still wield tremendous influence and could potentially stir a violent response from the militant wing of the Awami Party. Some senior officials are recommending the President should remove these Awami League opponents, before they either escape from prison or are released. They could easily rally a hostile opposition to the government. Other advisors believe this may backfire, they urge reconciliation. Releasing the political prisoners could buy good will. A decision must be made."
 Rahman_Assasination.9.d:0 "General Khaled Mosharaf, a highly decorated, senior Bangladeshi officer, working with pro-Mujibur Rahman military units, seized control of the government overnight. General Khaled Mosharaf, outraged by the assassination and protection of the assassins acted following reports that senior Awami League officials were killed in prison under suspicious circumstances. The current Army Chief, senior government officials, including President Khondaker Mostaq Khan and the assassins of Mujibur Rahman are either in detention or house arrest. In an address to the nation, Khaled Mosharaf promised to bring the killers of Mujibur Rahman to justice and restore chain of command in the military. Within hours of the announcement, thousands marched to commemorate Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, no longer fearing reprisals from the government. General Mosharaf has claimed the position of Army Chief and President."
 Rahman_Assasination.10.d:0 "The chaos in Bangladesh continues following reports of a mutiny by soldiers opposed to the coup of General Khaled Mosharaf. The mutiny is being led by left-wing soldiers and officers, being directed by retired Colonel and JSD leader Abu Taher. The mutineers are arresting, killing, attacking officers loyal to General Mosharaf or the late Mujibur Rahman. Apparently, many of the mutinying soldiers believe the new leader is an Indian agent, bent on surrendering Bangladesh to India. Although Mosharaf claimed the title Army Chief from General Ziaur Rahman, the claim is not being recognized within the ranks. There are reports of intense fighting across the capital and around the home where Ziaur Rahman is currently being held. Time will tell what will happen."
 Rahman_Assasination.11.d:0 "Hours after reports of a leftist, military uprising, the situation in Bangladesh has changed again. General Khaled Mosharaf, who only days earlier overthrew the government, was killed during a counter-coup launched by revolting soldiers. General Ziaur Rahman, was released from his house arrest and has taken control of the government, reclaiming his title as Army Chief. Acting swiftly, General Ziaur ordered the immediate restoration of discipline and chain of command. Pro-Mosharaf officers and soldiers are under detention. All remaining political prisoners held by either the late General Mosharaf or the former President Khondaker Mostaq Khan are to be released or shifted to house arrest until a decision can be made. The leftist soldiers who released Ziaur were seeking a new socialist government, however, General Ziaur declared he will take over the situation without a socialist government or junta."
 Rahman_Assasination.12.d:0 "In the weeks following both a coup and counter-coup, General Ziaur Rahman has firmly restored order in the country and within the military. Officers and soldiers involved in both coup plots are being swiftly detained. Most notably, the retired Colonel Abu Taher, who influenced the coup which facilitated his release from house arrest was also detained. General Ziaur noted the uprising against General Mosharaf sought not to restore order but bring a socialist military state into power. If discipline is to be restored, all these movements must be stamped out of the barracks. In addition to restoring order in the military, General Ziaur has overseen an extensive deployment of security forces to lower lawlessness and restore order across the country. Many Bangladeshis are welcoming a new sense of calm and order being brought by the new regime."
 Rahman_Assasination.13.d:0 "A military tribunal convicted Colonel Abu Taher to hang for his crimes of treason and murder. The former JSD leader is accused of overseeing anti-state activities during the insurgency period. He was also accused of arranging the assassination of General Khaled Mosharaf and other officers loyal to him to facilitate a brutal socialist takeover of Bangladesh. His execution does not bode well for his own supporters within the Army, as many assumed they would enjoy immunity as their actions helped facilitate the return of General Ziaur to power. However, General Ziaur recognizes the influence of outside ideologies and personalities were crippling the discipline and order within the Army. His mass detention and trials of prominent military officers involved in recent coups are meant to restore discipline in the barracks."
 Rahman_Assasination.14.d:0 "General K.M. Shafiullah, the Army Chief of Bangladesh, and popular war hero, has overthrown President Khondaker Mostaq Khan. The General acted following reports that several Awami League members died under mysterious circumstances in prison. For General Shafiullah, this was the last draw. A prominent Mujibur Rahman supporter, he had been shocked by his assassination but helped keep the nation together in the aftermath. However, the failure of President Mostaq Khan to bring the assassins to justice and the recent suspicious jailhouse killings made the situation intolerable for the general and his senior officers. Bangladeshi troops are out on the streets. In an address to the nation, the new leader promised justice for the late Mujibur Rahman and stability for a nation rocked by instability."
 Rahman_Assasination.15.d:0 "Retired Colonel Abu Taher, a former leader in the JSD, organized a Marxist uprising from junior officers and soldiers loyal to the vision of a socialist revolution. The leftist soldiers rapidly moved to seize control of major formations and assassinate General K.M. Shafiullah. There are reports of sporadic fighting across military cantonments in the country. The residence of the Army Chief is also said to be a scene of intense firing. It appears Colonel Taher is seeking to take advantage of the current instability in the country in order to establish a revolutionary socialist state. The coming hours will reveal any changes to the situation on the ground."
 Rahman_Assasination.16.d:0 "The leftist counter-coup against General K.M. Shafiullah has collapsed in disorder. The popular Army Chief was able to rally his supporters and issue commands rapidly during the violence. His own loyal troops were able to halt an assassination team from targeting the general at his home. Thousands of rebel soldiers, officers, and civilian sympathizers are under detention. They are expected to face trial. Colonel Abu Taher, who organized the attempt, was killed during the fighting. Addressing the nation, General Shafiullah praised the armed forces for remaining steadfast in their duty to the nation. With his rule firmly consolidated, he can now focus on restoring the revolution, as envisioned by the late Mujibur Rahman."
 Rahman_Assasination.17.d:0 "The JSD, taking advantage of the military infighting between the senior commanders, has captured a number of military installations. Pro-JSD officers and soldiers within several bases joined with the rebels outside to seize the facilities. The action has successfully cut off a few senior officers from their own loyal units. An attempt to organize a unified response by General Khaled Mosharaf failed as many units continue to refuse his commands or recognize him as the Army Chief. Abu Taher, the leader of the JSD and a former colonel, is said to be coordinating the JSD movements from a recently captured communications center."
 Rahman_Assasination.18.d:0 "The tumultuous effort by General Khaled Mosharaf to seize power ended in his assassination. The details remain sketchy, but it is believed rebel soldiers, perhaps loyal to the JSD, shot him as he coordinated operations against his opposition. The JSD leader Abu Taher soon announced on state radio that the JSD had seized control and would bring the people security. Military vehicles are now patrolling the streets, carrying mixed groups of JSD fighters and pro-JSD soldiers. Those senior officers who opposed Khaled Mosharaf and the JSD are believed to be in JSD custody. The chaotic infighting among the senior military leaders opened the way for a full JSD takeover."

 Khondaker_Regime.1.d:0 "There is increased tension within the military. The professional officers, trained during the colonial and Pakistan period continue to assert themselves as the most elite officers in the military. The freedom fighters and youth wing fighters from before independence were integrated into the military after independence. Those promoted to officers are complaining the professional officers marginalize them, preventing their promotions. The professional officers are demanding we support their policy of converting the integrated elements into their vision for the Army. The former freedom fighters advocate the establishment of a more national, peoples army. The President must decide which faction to back."
 Khondaker_Regime.2.d:0 "President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad praised the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a recent speech. He called the assassins sons of the sun for their actions. He claimed had the officers not acted, the government and nation faced the risk of total collapse. In his concluding remarks, he called for the nation to come together and ended his speech with Bangladesh Zindabad. Notably changing the previous slogan from Joy Bangla. The remarks are being received with a reaction of surprise and anger. Many Bangladeshis are now convinced their new leader was involved in the assassination. Loyalists to the late Mujibur Rahman are said to be infuriated by the remarks."
 Khondaker_Regime.3.d:0 "There is an increased fear among Bangladeshis that India enjoys too many privileges and influence in the country. This feeling is especially prevalent among the officer corps. The government will implement a new foreign policy to reduce Indian influence on the country. We will increase restrictions on border crossings, call for India to reduce its diplomatic missions, and implement more trade restrictions. We leaked some news ahead of time and the public seems to agree with this new direction in policy. The Indians must know they cannot infringe on our sovereignty."
 Khondaker_Regime.4.d:0 "The cabinet noted the previous policy of nationalizing the economy had occurred far too rapidly in the country. It stated support for a society where workers, the nation, and economy could all flourish together. However, expert reports confirmed the state lacked the capacity to effectively run all the industries it had nationalized. As such, the cabinet decided on a program to privatize a percentage of government industries. The government hopes this will spur spending and drive dynamic growth in the economy. Several unions and Awami League officials expressed concern over the decision. However, for many Bangladeshis suffering in a stagnant economy, they are willing to try anything for growth."

 Shafiullah.1.d:0 "General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, met with his senior military commanders to discuss the fate of those who killed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. One group of officers believe a public trial should occur in which the brutal details of the assassination can be understood by the population. Then the killers can be executed to provide justice to the whole nation. However, another group of officers worry such a trial could lead to backlash against the military as a whole. Instead, they argue the killers should be tried in a private court martial, to minimize anti-military rhetoric and show the nation how the military deals with traitors. President Shafiullah must make a difficult decision."
 Shafiullah.2.d:0 "The public trial of those military officers involved in the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ended today. The nation was stunned to hear how a group of mid-level officers armed themselves, stormed the Rahman residence, and butchered him, along with his family. Only by not being in the country were his two daughters spared. The prosecution hinted that senior military officers may have privately facilitated the coup, however, the government already announced there would be no other trials. The eight assassins, including three majors, all claimed they acted to save the nation from corruption and dictatorship. The verdict will be announced in a few days, with many expecting a guilty verdict followed by an execution."
 Shafiullah.3.d:0 "The Bangladesh military announced its court martial would soon release the verdict of the eight men involved in assassinating the late President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Details of the trial were kept from the general public. The military claimed the case was under military jurisdiction and it would see justice be done. Though there was some initial public discontent over the privacy in the case, many Bangladeshis eagerly await to hear the ruling. The civil lawyers for the accused were not allowed to participate in the court martial and have called the trial a sham. The trial is also being viewed with suspicion from the media in India."
 Shafiullah.4.d:0 "The assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were sentenced to death in court yesterday. The eight men will be hanged in the coming days. Thousands of Awami League supporters took the streets to celebrate this justice for their late leader. The court was not persuaded by the assassins argument that they killed the President to prevent a dictatorship and save the nation. General K.M. Shafiullah, the current President, welcomed the court decision. Three Army majors are among the convicted. Although the government and Awami League welcome the news, there are reports of unrest within the military and among more conservative circles. They believe the accused are being scapegoated and painted in a way to malign the military and other conservative political parties. Many military officers believed the removal of Mujibur Rahman was justified considering his political actions and closeness to India."
 Shafiullah.5.d:0 "The military announced the verdict of its court-martial, all eight involved in assassinating Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were sentenced to death. The military added the executions by hanging were already carried out. The news caught many in the country off-guard. A large Awami League rally in honor of the late Mujibur Rahman was hastily organized. Many in the country were critical of the military trial due to its secretive nature, but welcomed the verdict. Within the military, there are some who feel the court made the accused scapegoats. These officers feel the assassination was justified due to the political instability plaguing the nation. The government released a statement welcoming the news and confirming there would be no other trials connected to the assassination. For many Bangladeshis, the incident is resolved, at least for now."
 Shafiullah.6.d:0 "Officers and soldiers who joined the national army from the pre-independence resistance movement known as the Mukti Bahini complain of being isolated in the military. They claim the pre-independence soldiers and officers, all professionally trained, systematically ensure the MB personnel do not receive promotions or attractive postings. The President must decide whether to allow the Army to remain dominated by the professional military class, or insist on a true integration of the forces. Supporting the professional military class would keep the military structure as is, with the MB personnel eventually being retired out of service. Backing the MB personnel will push the military towards a more peoples army organization."
 Shafiullah.7.d:0 "Since taking power, General K.M. Shafiullah has worked tirelessly to identify and neutralize threats to the state. The more militant conservative elements were largely neutralized even before he took power. However, Marxists have long been engaged in violent acts and the hostile infiltration of both the government and military. In response to this threat, General Shafiullah recently ordered a mass crackdown of dangerous Marxist organizations across the nation. Security forces have detained government, military, and public officials identified as pro-Marxist. In addition, a number of student leaders and rural agitators were also detained.

 Shafiullah.8.d:0 "General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, announced new elections will be held in the near future. The respected war hero noted his regime was restoring stability. Across both society and state institutions. The leader did not give a specific date on when elections would be held but stated crime and corruption must be further reduced for an election to be possible. He added that following the election, he would retire from the military, having accomplished his duty to the nation and the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. All political parties will be allowed to participate and campaign openly. The announcement was well-received across Bangladesh. The Awami League appears ready to start its campaigning while the opposition parties are expected to form a coalition to oppose them. Although there is no firm date on elections, the people are satisfied with the present course of the nation."
