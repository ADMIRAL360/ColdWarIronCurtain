 treaty_san_francisco.1.d:0 "Today the San Francisco Peace Treaty was officially signed by 48 nations between Japan and the Allied Powers. This treaty serves to officially end Japan's position as an imperial power, to allocate compensation to Allied civilians and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes during World War II, and to end the American-led Allied post-war occupation of Japan and return sovereignty. This treaty made extensive use of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies' goals. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States. This treaty also introduced the problem of the legal status of Taiwan due to its lack of specificity as to what country Taiwan was to be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is still undetermined. Nevertheless, the island nation of Japan has become independent, with rising challenges and prospects."

 japan.1.d:0 "Ever since the Japanese defeat at the end of the Second World War, the country has been under American military occupation and allowed no armed forces. However, with the rising tensions of the Cold War the American government has taken increasing steps towards developing Japan as a Capitalist ally in the East. With American forces facing engagements in the Korean War, Japan's incredibly exposed and vulnerable position has not gone unnoticed. Leftist and Communist-aligned strikes and demonstrations have also inflamed the situation and the United States clearly now sees it prudent to allow Japan to form its own military again. The Japanese government has now officially authorized the creation of a national military, however its role is to be limited specifically to self defense and will be tightly monitored by the US, still wary from the World War merely a decade prior. No matter the restrictions, the creation of the Japanese military helps reinforce the precarious Allied position in Asia, whilst highlighting Japan's new found national sovereignty."

 japan.3.d:0 "Japan has undergone three major waves of municipal consolidation since the Meiji Restoration. The first wave, often referred to as the Great Meiji Restoration, came in 1888 and 1889, coinciding with the introduction to Japan of the modern local government system. The number of municipalities was reduced from 71,314 to 15,859 through this first round of mergers. The new proposed 'Great Heisei Consolidation' will help the nation’s efforts to cope with the changes brought about by the so-called post-war reforms as well as fully utilize the small land area of the island country for industry and urbanization. The number of municipalities is planned to be slashed from 9,868 to 3,472."

 japan.4.t:0 "The Red Purge"
 japan.4.d:0 "With the recent introduction of the 'Truman Doctrine', the United States had announced its unyielding stance against communism, with Japan as a target to cleanse it from far-leftist radicals. Last year, with the US diplomat, George Kennan, pressuring MacArthur to change his moderate policy, unrest spilled out between spring and summer as a series of demonstrations and protests by laborers, students and teachers, were held across the major cities of Japan. Unsurprisingly, after approval from Washington, the occupation authorities along with the Eighth Army aggressively suppressed these movements. The infamous "Hanshin Education Incident" occured in April when the Japanese authorities under the directions of the US government and the Japanese Ministry of Education closed down private Korean ethnic schools operating in Japan; it is said such actions were prompted by the fears of possible communist infiltration in the schools. Furthermore, later in September, then-Prime Minister of Japan, Hitoshi Ashida, was arrested along with some of his cabinet officials.\nWith the fresh legacy of last year's events, economic uncertainity, the Japanese Communist Party's political endeavors and the formation of the student associations, the Zengakuren, communism is only bound to spread across the nation if left unchecked; thus, the situation neccessitates the continuation of slamming the red menace."
 japan.4.a:0 "Such measures have to be taken..."
 japan.5.d:0 "As the part of the ongoing 'Red Purge' to curb the growing communist threat in Japan, the GHQ's Civil and Information and Education Section (CIE) has made plans to ensure the education system stays pure from any far-leftist ideals. For this purpose, the authorities dispatched Dr. Walter C. Eells, who serves at the GHQ as an advisor on higher education, to thirty national universities to call for immediate dismissal of communist professors and staff. On 16th July, Eells visited Niigata University and labelled communism as "dangerous and destructive doctrine". Due to his ideals, anti-communism is slowly becoming a nationwide sentiment and openly shunned by the newspapers. Plus, there have been noticeable dismissals of communist sympathizers from educational institutes, mostly over irrelevant reasons. This endeavor is commonly known as the 'Eells Typhoon', or 'Izuru Senpu', as the Japanese call it.\nSome people argue that Eells's actions are a blatant suppression of academic freedom in Japan, while some would defend him, claiming that the CIE was never directly involved in the red purge. Either way one thing remains clear, that the 'Izuru Senpu' is a critical element in the ongoing red purge."
