  Soviet_Op_North.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union is accused of deporting thousands of Jehovah Witnesses from the Baltic and other Eastern European areas to Siberia. Reports indicate the Ministry of State Security recently carried out decrees on the deportations and confiscation of properties. The numbers of Jehovah Witnesses are said to be in the thousands. The Jehovah Witnesses have long run afoul of Soviet authorities by refusing to participate in state functions, including serving in the military. For many Soviet officials, these religious beliefs represented a direct challenge to the state that had to be rooted out before it spread to other populations. The action is likely to garner some international criticism over religious persecution."
  SOV_PRC_Treaty.1.d:0 "The two global socialist giants have much to gain in cooperation. The treaty guarantees an alliance between China and the Soviet Union. The treaty ensures desperately needed aid to the new Chinese regime. The ports of Dalian and Lushun will also be returned to China. The Soviets gain privileges in Xinjiang and Manchuria. Both states will benefit as the socialist world unites in partnership."
