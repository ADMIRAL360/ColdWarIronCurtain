  Soviet_Op_North.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union is accused of deporting thousands of Jehovah Witnesses from the Baltic and other Eastern European areas to Siberia. Reports indicate the Ministry of State Security recently carried out decrees on the deportations and confiscation of properties. The numbers of Jehovah Witnesses are said to be in the thousands. The Jehovah Witnesses have long run afoul of Soviet authorities by refusing to participate in state functions, including serving in the military. For many Soviet officials, these religious beliefs represented a direct challenge to the state that had to be rooted out before it spread to other populations. The action is likely to garner some international criticism over religious persecution."
  SOV_PRC_Treaty.1.d:0 "The two global socialist giants have much to gain in cooperation. The treaty guarantees an alliance between China and the Soviet Union. The treaty ensures desperately needed aid to the new Chinese regime. The ports of Dalian and Lushun will also be returned to China. The Soviets gain privileges in Xinjiang and Manchuria. Both states will benefit as the socialist world unites in partnership."

  STALIN_Heavy_Industry_Development_desc:0 "While we have large industrial centers across our nation, our capacity to produce heavy equipment and machinery still lags behind that of Western powerhouses like the US. Only a concerted effort to develop our industry will change that."
  STALIN_Utilize_German_Rocketry_Knowledge_desc:0 "When we swept through Germany at the end of the Great Patriotic War 5 years ago, we captured many prominent German scientists, among them a few highly skilled rocket engine researchers. By putting them to work we can advance our knowledge."
  STALIN_Prioritize_Electronic_Developments_desc:0 "New advances are being made in the electronics department daily in the West, and yet much of our rural areas lack basic power facilities. We need to improve their infrastructure as well as keep up with the high tech advances of our day."
  STALIN_Aid_Ukranian_Reconstruction_desc:0 "Ukraine in particular was hard hit by the Nazi dogs during their brief occupation, and much of its infrastructure was destroyed. A large effort will need to be made to restore it."
  STALIN_Rebuild_Ukranian_Agriculture_desc:0 "The Fascists also ruined the region's farms and food producing industries when they invaded, shipping much of the goods and supplies back to their homeland. Our people are already rationing food, so we need to get the Bread Basket of West Russia up and running again."
  STALIN_Rebuild_Destroyed_Dams_desc:0 "Many dams were destroyed during the war, damaging many villages in the area surrounding them as well as taking away the dams' ability to provide hydroelectric power. Both of those reasons are more than enough for us to start repairing dams."
  STALIN_Invest_in_the_Baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic region has suffered much in the past few decades, being assimilated into the Union less than a few years before being run over by the German War Machine, and then bearing the effects of Scorched Earth policies. Investing in to the area will only do good."
  STALIN_Rebuild_Stalingrad_desc:0 "Stalingrad is home of the graves of many heroes of the Union, and site of one of our finest moments of the Great Patriotic War. However, all that doesn't change the devastation it saw during the battle for it, and we need to restart its industries. "
  STALIN_Open_New_Metallurgy_Plants_desc:0 "Rare Earth Metals are becoming more and more important for the production of high tech electronics and advanced weapons and vehicles, and increasing our mining and production ventures will benefit us greatly."
  STALIN_Complete_the_Don_Volga_Canal_desc:0 "The Don-Volga Canal is an important project, vital to our Agricultural sector in the South of the Union, and by completing it we will improve local infrastructure and food production capabilities."
  STALIN_Repair_Mining_Pits_desc:0 "By repairing mining pits and the overall industry, we can increase our metal exports and production."
  STALIN_Eliminate_Infrastructure_Bottlenecks_desc:0 "The state of our roads and general infrastructure, while being a useful tool to slow the Nazi advance, is in a miserable state for peacetime commerce, and must be improved."
  STALIN_Increase_Cement_Production_desc:0 "Cement is a vital material for the construction of all kinds of things, from bridges and roads to buildings and fortifications, and we need to have more of it."
  STALIN_Build_New_Railways_desc:0 "Building new railways is a good way to improve regional infrastructure as well as make it easier to transport goods and troops."
  STALIN_Connect_the_Union_desc:0 "To complete our new industrial and infrastructure improvements, we should create a vast system of roads and highways to connect our vast country. From Leningrad in the Baltic to Sebastopol in the Black sea to Vladivostok in the far east, our comrade citizens will have freedom to travel like never before."
  STALIN_The_Soviet_Armed_Forces_desc:0 "Our military is one of the most powerful in the world- when it comes to size. However, we lag behind the West's level of research and development in several key areas, most notably jet technology and any semblance of a proper navy."
  STALIN_The_Soviet_Airforce_desc:0 "Our air force was a large part of the victory in the Great Patriotic War, as our fearless aviators crushed the Luftwaffe into submission. But, a new age of flight has come, this time powered by the Jet Engine, and we need to leap into this age fullhearted."
  STALIN_Expand_MiG_15_Production_desc:0 "Mass production of the MiG-15, one of the best jet fighters our scientist comrades have produced to date, will do wonders for the Airforce's capabilities."
  STALIN_Develop_Sakhallin_Airfields_desc:0 "The Sakhalin airfields are the far-east region of our country's largest, but are still woefully small. Expanding them will benefit us greatly."
  STALIN_Develop_the_Tu_16_desc:0 "The Tu-16 is a proposed design for a Jet Strategic Bomber by Tupolev Industries, and it looks very promising. We should authorize further research and development. "
  STALIN_Invest_in_Supersonic_Fighters_desc:0 "Supersonic Fighters are the future of Air to Air Combat and we cannot allow ourselves to fall behind in this crucial area."
  STALIN_The_Soviet_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army was last in combat when it smashed the Wehrmacht and brought Berlin to its knees, winning us eternal glory in the Second World War. However, we cannot rest on our laurels, as warfare is ever changing and so must we."
  STALIN_Begin_Mass_Production_of_the_T54_desc:0 "The T-54 Main Battle Tank is our latest MBT design, and is far superior to any American tank in production. Distributing it throughout our army will increase our technological edge over the West."
  STALIN_Rapid_Adoption_of_the_AK47_desc:0 "The AK-47 is the latest brilliant design to come from Mikhail Kalashnikov, and it is a beautiful assault rifle with an innovative design- yet still cheap to manufacture. We need to start producing this right away."
  STALIN_Expand_the_VDV_desc:0 "The VDV is our elite paratrooper branch of the army. While the tactics and strategies for their use are still being formed, Airborne soldiers are still good to have around."
  STALIN_Increase_Soviet_Air_Defense_Forces_desc:0 "In addition to our Aircraft, ground anti-air units are also responsible for the defense of our skies. Increasing such units will in turn increase our defense capability."
  STALIN_The_Soviet_Navy_desc:0 "The Soviet Navy is small, weak, and outdated. Without even a carrier to our name, we can never hope to match the Americans on the high seas. However, we cannot ignore our surface or submarine fleets entirely."
  STALIN_Project_30bis_desc:0 "Project 30bis is the name for a modern, top of the line destroyer which will greatly enhance our Navy's escort capabilities, and we should invest in it heavily."
  STALIN_Modernize_the_Black_Sea_Shipyards_desc:0 "While the dockyards on the Black Sea are many, they are also quite outdated and inefficient. This needs to change, and soon."
  STALIN_Study_German_Submarine_Designs_desc:0 "We captured quite a few German Submarines- and the researchers who designed them- at the end of the Second World War. By studying U-Boat designs, we can improve our own submarine fleet."
  STALIN_Ramp_Up_Submarine_Production_desc:0 "Submarines are the only chance we have at doing any damage to Western Ships or shipping if we ever come to conflict. We need to make sure our fleet is up to the task."
