 Green_Revolution.1.d:0 "For decades, the Indian people were victims of famine and food insecurity. Even during the last war the colonial regime took food from the people to feed its war machine, continuing the erosion of agriculture. However, with new advances in technology and a government for the people, India will embark on a campaign to end dependence on foreign food aid and transform India into a breadbasket for Asia. Government programs combined with new research are to guide this historic program. A senior government official noted the colonial regime brought India frequent famines and failed to increase productivity as the population grew. India plans to address these issues and provide farmers the finance support they need to grow."
 Green_Revolution.2.d:0 "Parliament passed legislation guaranteeing national funding for the development of agriculture. Some of the funds will go to universities to investigate the causes of food insecurity and develop new techniques and technologies for expanding production. Other funding will secure the import and domestic development of higher yield and more disease resistant wheat and modern fertilizers. Campaigns are to be launched across the country to encourage farmers to adopt more effective irrigation techniques and to use the new technologies."
 Vietnam_IND.2.d:0 "The United States requests our support for their effort in Vietnam. They are not asking for combat troops but are saying we should at least provide a military field hospital to support the South Vietnamese people. It is clear our refusal to do so may result in an end to the current wheat aid they provide us. Some in the government believe we should offer public support for the American position. They argue the aid we get is not relevant, but accepting the American request could counter-balance the rise of global communist activists in the country. We could also expect greater American support and investments. Other officials believe we should remain firm and maintain our integrity as an international state. Supporting the neo-colonial war will only divide the republic and betray the values on which it was founded."
 Vietnam_IND.3.d:0 "The Indian government agreed to dispatch a field hospital to South Vietnam and publicly support our position in Vietnam. This will greatly hinder the communist propaganda in Asia and legitimize our cause. More importantly, senior Indian officials will now work to combat this propaganda and defend us in order to justify their actions. This is a major coup for our government. Greater effort will be made to convince American corporations and investors to focus on India, given their sensible foreign policy."
 CPI_FP.1.d:0 "In a stirring address to the nation, the Indian Prime Minister announced the withdrawal of India from the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister noted the organization served simply to continue colonial influence across former colonies and India had to leave for its true independence. After the speech, the Indian government released its own statement condemning the organization for refusing to support anti-colonial movements and legitimizing Western aggression against peaceful states. The British government expressed its disappointment and rejected the Indian accusations. The Commonwealth organization released its own statement claiming the organization simply promoted stronger ties among its members who have a shared history."
 CPI_FP.2.d:0 "The Indian government expressed its support for the Soviet Union and called on China to halt its hostile propaganda and actions. The Indian government noted the Soviet Union had a long history of supporting freedom movements and offering support to developing states. The move will likely anger the Chinese government, which has long viewed the increasingly close ties between the Soviets and Indians with concern. A leading Chinese newspaper claimed the Soviets planned on using ties with India to strategically surround China. It added that India remained a colonial client, willing to sell itself to the highest bidder. Indian newspapers were quick to support the government and condemn the Chinese for its policy of antagonism and internal repression. The Soviet Union welcomed the announcement and invited the Indian Prime Minister to visit."
 India_Reconciliation.1.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested talks with our government. The Indians claim they wish to reset relations and end the years of animosity since Partition. It is likely the Indians want to normalize relations and establish stronger trade ties. Some of our advisors feel this may help out our economy which is reeling from the recent war and losses. In addition, this could build support among the liberal elements of society. However, India is likely capitalizing on their recent military success and to engage them may be seen as acknowledging our weak position. It may be better for the morale of our people to reject this initiative and focus on our efforts to rebuild. We must decide how to respond."
 India_Reconciliation.2.d:0 "During our talks with India, they have proposed a complete normalization of relations along with an agreement to ease immigration restrictions. The agreement would improve relations, especially trade ties. Our own population would likely support the easing of immigration, this would allow the reunion of families and friends long separated by Partition and offer opportunity for some citizens to reclaim lost properties. However, there is some resistance, especially among senior military officers who believe the best approach would be to walk away from the talks and end the talks. This would assert Pakistani defiance. We must decide how to respond."
 India_Reconciliation.3.d:0 "Our recent effort to normalize relations with Pakistan has ended in success. The Pakistanis agreed to sign a range of agreements which will improve trade, normalize relations, and ease immigration restrictions. News of the agreement is already being positively received domestically and internationally. The world now sees India is a new type of power. Indians and Pakistanis can now become like the brothers and sisters they were meant to be. We are not a militarist power or imperialistic, instead we are a peace-loving nation devoted to continuous peace."
 India_Reconciliation.4.d:0 "The Indian effort at normalizing ties with Pakistan ended in embarrassing failure. The Pakistanis condemned the Indians for seeking to cement their recent successes and turn Pakistan into an Indian puppet. The Pakistan government released a further statement claiming they will never give up on their desire to liberate the people of Kashmir and prevent India from becoming a hegemonic power in South Asia. The Indian government responded by saying Pakistan was politicizing a genuine effort at peace and they had only revealed their desire for war."

 india.7.t:0 "People's Republic of India Established!"
 india.7.d:0 "Today in Delhi, the flag of the People's Republic of India was raised and the Republic of India flag lowered. The People's Republic of India has claimed victory in their revolutionary war against the Republic of India. The PRI leadership has said they have liberated the country from the princes and corrupt Republican Indian leaders that took from rightful commoners. The last of Republic of India forces and people have crossed into neighboring Pakistan or Burma and also left to Ceylon. NATO has called this a failure and a setback in the South Asia region. Cominform is calling this a success for opening up the doors to South Asia and the Middle East for liberation and revolution. The fighting has ended in India, but the exiled Indians have claimed that the fight is not over."
 india.7.a:0 "What will happen to India now?"
 india.8.t:0 "Communist Rebellion Fails in India!"
 india.8.d:0 "The last rebel forces in the state of Hyderabad have been found in the mountains and surrendered. The People's Republic of India has surrendered in Hyderabad after the last of their forces were hunted down by the Indian Army. India has instituted a occupation force to make sure any last forces are wiped out. The Republic of India has called this a great victory in their country."

 Vietnam_IND.1.d:0 "The situation in Vietnam continues to escalate. Internationally, the North Vietnamese propaganda has resonated across the post-colonial states, including India. The Indian government does not do much to  curb such blatant support for the communist rebels. Our diplomatic missions report a rise in anti-Americanism and an increasing view that the war we are fighting is a war of colonialism, not one to protect the Vietnamese people from communist tyranny. The State Department recommends we call for the Indian government to openly back our position, educate the population, and dispatch a military field hospital to South Vietnam. Asking for combat troops would not be realistic, but such a support would strengthen our position and legitimacy in Asia. If India resists, we can threaten to cut our wheat aid. Some in the cabinet oppose this plan, claiming we will simply drive the Indians out of our camp and lose what leverage we have."
