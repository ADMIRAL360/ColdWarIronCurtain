 Burma_KW.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Burma strongly condemned the United States for its intervention in Korea. He said the current conflict must be resolved by the Korean people themselves and the United States is using the conflict to impose its own imperial order in Asia. The announcement has divided Burmese political leaders, especially conservatives and socialists. They fear the condemnation will only embolden Burmese communists and anger Western powers, who are an important source of economic aid for the country. However, the announcement has struck a chord with leftists and ordinary Burmese citizens who are still recovering from the traumas of British and Japanese imperialism."
 Burma_KW.3.d:0 "The AFPFL has decided to purge the Trade Union Congress in response to its President, Thakin Lwin, openly criticizing the AFPFL for its foreign policy. Lwin is clearly a hardcore communist, and the organization, setup as a socialist counterweight to the communist unions, needs to be cleaned up. The AFPFL will suspend the Trade Union Congress from its membership until it removes all communists, including Lwin from senior positions. Once it obeys these dictates, the organization can be reintegrated into the AFPFL. Some opposition publications cite the AFPFL acted after Lwin publicly criticized the government for supporting the United States in the Korean conflict."
 Pyidawtha.1.d:0 "Prime Minister U Nu has called together leading economic, political, and development officials to hold talks on a new development plan for the nation. In addition to consulting leading officials, the government also started contracts with outside engineering, economic consulting, and mining firms to help develop the plan. U Nu believes to leave the shackles of colonialism behind, Burma must strive forward with an ambitious plan of transformation. The goal of this development plan will be to make Burma economically competitive and lift its people from poverty at the fastest pace possible. The government plans on unveiling the details of its comprehensive plan at the upcoming development conference, called the Pyidwatha Conference."
 Pyidawtha.2.d:0 "The people of Burma and many international observers have been captivated by the newly proposed eight-year development plan of Prime Minister U Nu. The details were unveiled during the Pyidawtha Conference on development. The Burmese government wishes to industrialize the nation and establish a welfare state. There are ten leading schemes involved with the plan, including a focus on nationalization, infrastructure, education, local government, and autonomy for regional governments. The plan is the culmination of intense planning by the government, who also hired some of the top foreign consulting and engineering firms to aid the effort. Despite the ambitious objectives, the government is confident it can achieve all its objectives. Although many people praise the economic aspects, there is some criticism from political rivals about whether empowering local government will spur anti-national feelings."
 AFPFL.1.d:0 "During the last election, the opposition National United Front managed to gain a large number of votes and seats, due to our electoral system. This leftist coalition successfully managed to take voters who we expected to vote with us. The NUF proved effective in building alliances with trade unions and peasant organizations. We also heard rumors that foreign embassies were also involved in offering support to the party. The NUF leaders proved adept at attracting and exploiting the media to their advantage throughout the election campaign. The party must take the time to analyze what the NUF do well and offer reforms to strengthen the AFPFL for the future."
 AFPFL.2.d:0 "Ba Swe has been appointed Prime Minister of Burma. The AFPFL leader U Nu decided not to take on the position. U Nu is said to be especially perturbed by the rapid electoral success of the opposition National Union Front and will spearhead efforts to analyze what reforms are necessary to re-strengthen the AFPFL. Ba Swe is a trusted deputy of U Nu and head of the Socialist Party. The new Prime Minister is expected to focus on pursuing the continued economic transformation of Burma."
 AFPFL.3.d:0 "There are reports of increasing infighting within the ruling AFPFL Party in Burma. It appears Prime Minister Ba Swe is growing increasingly unhappy with the senior party leader U Nu. Following recent elections, U Nu has sought to launch important reforms to strengthen the party apparatus and make it more competitive in upcoming elections. Some of his proposals are apparently alienating Ba Swe and others who disagree with leadership of U Nu. Supporters of Ba Swe are said to be rallying AFPFL members to support calls for fresh leadership in the party."
 AFPFL.4.d:0 "The Burmese government announced that U Nu will take over the premiership from Ba Swe. The new Prime Minister noted he had decided to take some time off to develop a vision for strengthening the national unity of Burma and the AFPFL. U Nu enjoys a great deal of popularity among many Burmese and his return to power will be well-received. However, there are reports of increasing tensions within the AFPFL as even some of the most loyal deputies of U Nu are said to be increasingly concerned with the leadership style of U Nu."
 AFPFL.6.d:0 "A recent party congress of the AFPFL revealed bitter divisions in the party. This internal strife continued until boiling over when former Prime Minister Ba Swe and senior party leader Kyaw Nyein led thirteen other ministers to resign from the government, effectively splitting the party. Most of the party has sided with Ba Swe and are called the Stable AFPFL while those still with U Nu are called the Clean AFPFL. Days later the Stable AFPFL sought a no-confidence motion in parliament, which was only defeated when the opposition, National United Front chose to support a beleaguered Prime Minister. Despite the dramatic split, it appears the division is largely a result of competing personalities as neither party announced a major shift from the traditional policies of the AFPFL. Many Burmese are increasingly concerned by this new round of political instability." 
 Burmese_Buddhism.0.d:0 "Prime Minister U Nu, a Theravada Buddhist spiritual leader, has initiated a program to promote Buddhism across the country. The effort will support a recent resurgence in Buddhist practices across Burma. U Nu strongly feels the tenants of Buddhism and its acceptance by many Burmese citizens make it an ideal means to promote national unity. Buddhist programs will be encouraged, and the government will take every effort to acquire Buddhist artifacts across the region. The cornerstone of this new approach will be plans to host a Great Synod."
 Burmese_Buddhism.1.d:0 "The Burmese government has decided to sponsor the Sixth Great Synod of Theravada Buddhism. The last council was held over eighty years ago. The government constructed a pagoda called the Kaba Aye Pagoda in Mahapasana Guha. A total of 2,500 Theraveda Buddhist elders from eight countries will be invited for the meeting. Prime Minister U Nu hopes the conference will showcase Burma as a center of Buddhist learning. The council will meet for around two years and the government plans on allowing visitors to pay pilgrimage to the site."
 Rohingya.1.d:0 "Our diplomatic mission in Burma reported the Burmese government has approached them, demanding we stop funding the Rohingya insurgency. They insist their position is not to eradicate Islam in Burma but to establish a unified state where all communities can prosper. From their perspective, our continued support is disruptive and the Burmese government is considering downgrading our diplomatic ties. In exchange for us halting aid to the Rohingya, the Burmese government is willing to improve diplomatic and trade ties, allowing us more access to their markets. Our intelligence officials believe we can continue to support the rebels, but continued fighting could result in a more aggressive crackdown by the Burmese Army, which could lead to a humanitarian crisis. The offer appears beneficial, however, there is no guarantee that the Burmese will keep its promise of not suppressing Islam in Burma after restoring its authority."
 Rohingya.2.d:0 "The Pakistani diplomatic mission quietly informed us they will ensure no parties interfere in our internal affairs. This will greatly weaken the Rohingya rebel movement. We did promise the Pakistanis there would not be retribution, but of course, we reserve the right to handle internal affairs how we see fit. To keep them happy, we will offer improved trade relations. This should be enough to prevent them from reengaging with the rebels at a later time. This is a major victory for our government and military position."
 Rohingya.3.d:0 "The Pakistani government has rebuffed our direct approach at demanding they stop arming the Rohingya rebels. They insist it is not Pakistani agents arming the rebels and there is no evidence of any Pakistani involvement in the matter. This is a major setback and laughable denial. The Pakistanis are clearly focused on this misguided attempt to interfere in our affairs. We will downgrade relations with Pakistan and redouble our efforts to uproot the rebels. The Army insists this will not stop them from restoring order and establishing national unity."
 Burma_Union.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister U Nu announced the establishment of the Bureau of Special Investigation. This new criminal agency will be under the direct authority of the Prime Minister. The agency will be responsible for investigating financial crimes, corruption, and the illegal flow of foreign cash. U Nu has grown increasingly concerned about the impact of corruption on governance and the role of foreign nations in supporting rebel movements. The opposition has raised concerns that the new organization will become a tool of the Prime Minister to punish and arrest opponents on flimsy grounds."
 NUF_1958.0.d:0 "In a major announcement, the Burmese government announced the communist rebel Liberation Army will halt its campaign and join the state. The Prime Minister noted the previous fighting had been caused by disagreements with the state but his government had resolved those concerns. This is a major success for the new National United Front government as it brings an end to a large, armed rebel group. Although many will welcome the news, there is increasing suspicion among Burmese conservatives that the NUF controlled the rebels and used them to put pressure on the previous government."
 Burma_Elect.1.d:0 "Burma is holding general elections to determine the next government. Due to ongoing security problems, voter turnout appears to be very low. The popular AFPFL is expected to win the election in an overwhelmingly as it managed to create alliances with many of the other parties contesting the polls. Despite the low turnout, the party will use this victory as a strong mandate to implement its vision for the nation. The AFPFL has promised economic and social development, but its main focus will be restoring national unity in the country. This means engaging with the many rebel factions currently operating in the country."
 BURMA_KMT_UN.1.d:0 "In the closing stages of the Chinese Civil War, thousands of Kuomintang (KMT) soldiers from the Republic of China crossed into our territory, where they established bases around Kengtung, on Shan land. These foreign military units are said to be training and preparing for an eventual armed invasion of China. Our attempts to have these men disarm and obey our authority has been rebuffed. The Kuomintang commander said he would resist any attempt by our military to restore our authority in the area. These foreign soldiers are exploiting our local people and resources. If they decide to invade China, we risk a full-on invasion from the Chinese communist government. A military campaign would be costly, so we must first approach the United Nations and ask for help on dealing with this KMT problem."
 Operation_Bayinnaung.1.d:0 "Our efforts at using the United Nations to negotiate a withdrawal of Kuomintang forces from our lands has borne some fruit. The international community accepts our position and some of the foreign forces have withdrawn. However, our intelligence agencies noted the withdrawal is very slow and many of the foreign combat troops remain. To swiftly resolve this crisis, the military has initiated Operation Bayinnaung, the largest inter-service operation ever conducted. We expect Kuomintang resistance will collapse fairly rapidly, finally bringing their occupation to an end."
 NUF_1958.4.d:0 "The National United Front strongly believes in a united Burma but strongly disagrees with the previous policy of using military power to exert central authority over all territory. After holding discussions, the NUF government has decided to make offers to the Karen and Mon leaders. Each group will be given the opportunity to end its armed rebellion, in exchange for regional autonomy. They must pledge loyalty to the Burmese government but will be granted extensive autonomy. The NUF believes its proposal ensures a rapid return to peace and economic prosperity for all citizens. Elements of the Burmese military and nationalists are unhappy with the proposal, arguing it is a surrender of the state."
 NUF_1958.5.d:0 "The Karan National Liberation Army announced it will accept the recent peace proposal offered by the National United Front government. The agreement calls for an end of all hostilities between Burmese forces and Karen fighters. In exchange, Karen will be granted extensive autonomy, being able to live according to their way of life, within the Burmese state. The news is being well-received in Karen and government-controlled parts of Burma. The NUF government claims it has taken another step towards a united Burma where all citizens can prosper in peace. There are rumors of anger, especially among conservative elites and some military officers, who feel the agreement is a surrender of Burmese territory to a rebel force."
 NUF_1958.6.d:0 "The Karen National Liberation Army announced it will not accept a recent peace proposal offered by the National United Front government. The agreement calls for an end of all hostilities between Burmese forces and Karen fighters. In exchange, Karen will be granted extensive autonomy, being able to live according to their way of life, within the Burmese state. The rebel group stated the Burmese government had made similar offers in the past, only to renegade on them. The news is a major setback for the NUF which promised to rapidly unite Burma. Opposition newspapers report that some in the military are privately furious with the government, whose generous offer only served to embolden the rebels into thinking they can achieve complete independence."
 NUF_1958.7.d:0 "The Mon National Liberation Army announced it will accept the recent peace proposal offered by the National United Front government. The agreement calls for an end of all hostilities between Burmese forces and Mon fighters. In exchange, Mon will be granted extensive autonomy, being able to live according to their way of life, within the Burmese state. The news is being well-received in Karen and government-controlled parts of Burma. The NUF government claims it has taken another step towards a united Burma where all citizens can prosper in peace. There are rumors of anger, especially among conservative elites and some military officers, who feel the agreement is a surrender of Burmese territory to a rebel force."
 NUF_1958.8.d:0 "The Mon National Liberation Army announced it will not accept a recent peace proposal offered by the National United Front government. The agreement calls for an end of all hostilities between Burmese forces and Karen fighters. In exchange, Mon will be granted extensive autonomy, being able to live according to their way of life, within the Burmese state. The rebel group stated the Burmese government had made similar offers in the past, only to renegade on them. The news is a major setback for the NUF which promised to rapidly unite Burma. Opposition newspapers report that some in the military are privately furious with the government, whose generous offer only served to embolden the rebels into thinking they can achieve complete independence."
 AFPFL.5.d:0 "The Burmese government announced that U Nu will take over the premiership from Ba Swe. The new Prime Minister noted he had decided to take some time off to develop a vision for strengthening the national unity of Burma and the AFPFL. U Nu enjoys a great deal of popularity among many Burmese and his return to power will be well-received. However, there are reports of increasing tensions within the AFPFL as even some of the most loyal deputies of U Nu are said to be increasingly concerned with the leadership style of the Prime Minister. Once settled into power, the Prime Minister will need to manage these conflicts or risk them escalating."
 AFPFL.7.d:0 "Prime Minister U Nu, following the split of the AFPFL and his narrow surviving of a no-confidence vote, has called on General Ne Win, Chief of Staff for the Armed Forces to become interim Prime Minister. General Ne Win promised his caretaker government will restore public order, provide stability, and then oversee fresh elections for a new government. Many are praising U Nu for his decision, noting he recognized following the AFPFL split that governing effectively would be impossible, especially since many AFPFL parliamentarians now oppose U Nu. The two AFPFL factions will look towards organizing themselves for the next election."
 Burma_FP.1.d:0 "Burma and the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) signed an agreement establishing formal diplomatic ties between both states. Historically, Burma and China have had centuries of trade, linguistic, and religious links with one another. The decision makes Burma among the first non-communist states to recognize the PRC government and has led to some criticism from Western embassies. Burmese government officials are generally saying that China is a major trading partner and neighboring state, to ignore it would only cause mistrust and unnecessary problems."
 Burma_Agreement.1.d:0 "The Burmese government announced it would honor the agreement signed by Aung San granting full autonomy to minority communities in Burma. The military has been ordered to withdraw from these spaces, along with federal officials. The Karen, Shan, Arakan, and Mon rebel forces are said to be celebrating, along with their supporters. Despite claims the government is simply honoring past commitments, it is clear the rebels have successfully forced the military out of their territory. It appears "full autonomy" is just a way by the government to downplay the fact that these areas are effectively independent from Burmese authority. The Burmese government hopes it can now concentrate its efforts at strengthening the economy in a Burma no longer rife with rebellion."
 Burma_KW.2.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Burma strongly condemned the North Korean invasion of South Korea. He noted this was an act of naked aggression by a regime desperate to violently impose its communist system on a peaceful state. He stated his support for international efforts to end the fighting and protect the South Korean people. The announcement is being well-received by Western embassies, who are trying to shore up international support against North Korea. Most political leaders support the statement, seeing it as a clear indication the Prime Minister will not tolerate communist violence and wants to strengthen ties with the West. However, Burmese communist leaders and union members are heavily criticizing the Prime Minister for being a Western imperialist tool."
 NUF_1958.2.d:0 "The Burmese government recently arrested the Chief of Staff for the Armed Forces on the grounds of plotting a coup. During his subsequent trial, he was charged with organizing death squads and illegally interfering in the governing of the state. Upon his conviction, he was swiftly executed. The execution has stunned the Burmese military and left its anti-communist officers leaderless. Many officers are considering retirement and the National United Front looks to fill senior positions with its loyalists. General Ne Win was seen by analysts as the likely man to either lead a coup against the NUF or preserve the independence of the military from political influence."
 NUF_1958.3.d:0 "Since the end of the Chinese Civil War, thousands of Kuomintang forces, organized as the Yunnan Anti-Communist National Salvation Army (YANSA), have occupied northern Burma, waiting for the order to invade China. These forces have long resisted Burmese efforts at restoring its authority in the area or even disarming these soldiers. However, the new leftist government, led by the National United Front party, has announced it can no longer abide with foreign military forces undermining state power. The Burmese military has been directed to remove YANSA by any means necessary. The decision does have support from many in the country. A spokesperson for YANSA stated the Burmese government is a stooge for international communism and that its forces will not stop its sacred mission."
 Burma_Elect.2.d:0 "The people in Burma are due to vote in the upcoming general elections. The wartime resistance party, the AFPFL, is a heavy favorite, and its leaders expect big results. Their main opponent, the National United Front, is also expressing confidence. During the election campaign it has sought to establish relationships with trade unions and peasant groups, drawing from the traditional AFPFL base of support. The NUF also brings together leftist and right-wing groups, offering a broad coalition. The election campaign has seen the NUF accuse the AFPFL of corruption while the AFPFL alleges the NUF receives foreign funding. Now it is up to the people of Burma to decide who will rule."
