 french_elections.18.d:0 "The people of France recently went to the polls for the latest legislative election. Many hope a new legislature may help move the country beyond the recent political and international upheaval facing the nation. However, it is clear a National Assembly divided into multiple parties will be the result again, but which coalition has achieved a majority is unknown. The Republican Front, a coalition of socialist parties seem to be the likely winner if their parties achieved the majority. If they did not achieve a majority than it is likely the center right parties will be forming the ruling coalition. Citizens across France wait to hear the final results and future destiny of their nation."
 fra_crisis_2_desc:0 "The frequent political instability in Paris and lack of direction over the Algerian War has raised anxiety within the French military. Many officers fear the politicians are betraying French honor and letting the nation down. The more radical officers converged in Algeria and recently decided to act. News soon reached a stunned French government that French generals in Algeria seized power from the civilian authorities. The new junta calls itself the Committee of Public Safety. They have called for strong leadership and the return of French hero Charles de Gaulle. Days later French troops in Algeria seized Corsica to add pressure on the government. De Gaulle has only stated he would serve the nation if called upon by the government. The French government must now decide whether to bring back de Gaulle, accept the Committee of Public Safety takeover, or offer a compromise for Algeria."

Combined, they represented up to 45% of the votes, and both aimed to block IVth Republic Legislation Process. Against this threat, the law stated that any list could connect itself with others; if the connected total score was above 50%, they would take all seats and distribute them between themselves. Since Gaullist or Communist wouldn't connect with anyone, they were assured to lose most of the constituencies."
 FRAPCF.1.d:0 "The government of France announced it officially acknowledges its historical role in the exploitation and oppression of the peoples in its Indochina colonies. However, the current government will not make the mistakes of the past or perpetuate the misery capitalism inflicts on people. The government has decided it will endorse all the liberation movements in Indochina and work to help these groups establish independent governments free of the influence of capitalist or imperial exploitation. This announcement by the French government is being cautiously welcomed in the French colonies and enthusiastically received among the urban intellectual classes of France.  However, among middle class and rural French, there has been a mixed reception as many in these communities view Indochina as part of the French global nation and believe it should remain French."
 FRAPCF.2.d:0 "With the Soviet Union increasingly showing repression and anti-democratic tendencies, many communists in Western Europe have grown increasingly alienated from it. In addition, the Soviet model increasingly appears alien to societies used to democratic approaches. These trends, along with a revision of Marxist theory has seen the emergence of Eurocommunism. Eurocommunism supports democratic institutions and encourages communist parties to ally with other groups to initiate largescale social reforms and achieve a democratic domination of society. The emphasis on the working class now expanded to include the middle class. Eurocommunism offers a new, democratic route towards socialism and communists who embrace it are also shifting away from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and traditional communists see Eurocommunism as a dangerous, revisionist route doomed for failure. However, for French communists, Eurocommunism offers a means to expand their base of support and demonstrate their independence within the global communist order."
 FRAPCF.3.d:0 "The French Communist Party has decided, after intense meetings, that France will embrace Anarchism. Anarchism will maintain a minimal state and ensure all citizens have absolute freedom. Free associations will likely begin to emerge, and France will soon be the freest nation on the planet. France will no longer be enslaved by the capitalist order as its people will no longer be controlled by state mechanisms. Many in France are connecting this new turn as a continuation of the anarchic experiments in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War. Although those experiments were snuffed out, their legacy endures and now Anarchism will be the way of France. Neighboring states have expressed alarm and concern, though stating they will wait and see what Anarchism will entail. In capitals across Europe, crowds of anarchists took to the streets to celebrate the news from France."
 PCF_ALG.1.d:0 "The communist government in France declared the senseless violence, exploitation, and misery will end in Algeria. It has decided to grant Algeria independence and let it be run by its own people. The French government stated it was the capitalist system and imperialist pressures which has forced France to fight to control Algeria. Now that these pressures no longer influence the government, it is clear that the war in Algeria serves no greater purpose and must be brought to a just conclusion. Within France, the decision has a lot of support in urban areas but in rural France and among the middle class, there is a sense of betrayal. For them Algeria was never a colony, but an extension of the motherland and they see the government announcement as a betrayal not only of the nation but of the French population which currently lives in Algeria."
 ALG_CRACKDOWN.1.d:0 "The French government has already declared its opposition to decolonization with regards to Algeria. In their view, Algeria is not a colony, but a part of the French metropole and it must be preserved against barbaric and foreign ideologies. In support of this stance, the French government confirmed it had approved a new campaign to pacify Algeria. Media reports from Algeria indicate French forces have engaged in a widespread operation, utilizing aggressive search tactics, heavy weapons, and at times indiscriminate firing in order to uproot and crackdown on the independence movement. This new intensity to violence has encouraged many in France who believe the government should do whatever is necessary in order to resolve the crisis. However, there have also been protests to the brutality and internationally, many states have already expressed their concern over the disproportionate use of force being used by the French military."
 Petain.100.d:0 "Following the death of Philippe Petain, debate has emerged on where the former French General and President should be buried. Petain had been among the greatest French generals in World War I, leading French forces during the battle of Verdun. However, his legacy became controversial when during World War II he led the pro-Nazi French puppet government in Vichy. He is reviled by many but revered among many veterans and nationalists in France. After the war he was convicted for treason and spent the rest of his life in a prison cell on the Ile d'Yeu. Following his death, plans were made to bury him on the Ile d'Yeu but many French nationalists have demanded he be buried at the Douaumont Necropolis along with the French graves from Verdun. The French government must decide whether to bury him in the Ile d'Yeu or appease the nationalists and bury him in Verdun."

The Red Wave has reentered France once again."

This is certainly a development."
