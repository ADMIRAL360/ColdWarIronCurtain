 Karen_Conflict_desc:0 "The British colonial regime long utilized the Karen to take important posts of administration and the military. Karen soldiers played a leading role in liberating Burma from Japanese occupation. Following the independence of Burma, the Karen grew increasingly concerned over the nationalist tone of the new government and its policies towards minorities. A failure of the government to form a pact with minorities saw Karen leaders organize military units of veterans under the Karen National Union. The government replied by deploying the army against these rebels, however, many of its units, consisting of Karens, defected. The government is seeking to rebuild its military power while the Karen seek to press their current advantage.\n\nCurrent Burmese Government Victory Points: [?BMR.Karen_Conflict_Strength]\nCurrent Karen National Liberation Army Victory Points: [?KAY.Karen_Conflict_Strength]"
