 WMD.3.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader] Diplomatic Incident, as Soviet Union demands return of American 'Spy'"
 WMD.3.d:0 "Moscow, USSR: A crazed man, crashed hectically into the lobby of the American Embassy while Russian authorities remained in hot pursuit. \n\nClaiming diplomatic immunity and creating quite a scene, bystanders remained shocked as the man hysterically screamed of a Nuclear first strike by the Soviet Union that had already been set in motion. \n\nEyewitnesses recount the mans voice cracking and the hoarse words piercing the ears of all those present, as he fell to his knees and lay silent. The American Embassy is yet to comment on the incident, and the man known only as 'Dmitri Polyakov' is currently in American custody."
 
 WMD.31.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Reports of Multiple Possible Nuclear Launches Across the United States"
 WMD.31.d:0 "Wamego, Kansas: The rustic town, accustomed to the sound of livestock and children playing in the streets, had come to a stand still. \n\n The men, woman and children stared into the distance in pure horror. Hundreds of streaks of light had risen from the ground and had lifted to the heavens, painting the horizon in only smoke. \n\nPerhaps they were some of the first people to have realized what lay forward for humanity, and it seemed as if the sheer terror had frozen them in place. "
 
 WMD.6.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]A Soviet Retaliatory Strike?"
 WMD.6.d:0 "After the initial nuclear strike on the Soviet Bloc and after a day of radio silence, President [?USA.GetLeader] had declared that the Communist Beast had been slain once and for all. \n\nHowever, international space agencies have reported the launch of massive number of missiles from deep in the Soviet heartland. As of now, these reports cannot be confirmed, however the President has assured a successful and debilitating first strike has rendered the Soviets incapable of any response. "
 
 WMD.7.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]An American Retaliatory Strike?"
 WMD.7.d:0 "Cheyenne, Wyoming: Our town seems to have been spared by the first salvo of Red Missiles, as a lingering nightmare finally manifests itself. Reports of entire cities being wiped off the face of the Earth and firestorms consuming the rest have sent fears of being the target of another strike to render this continent devoid of life. \n\nThe President, [USA.GetLeader] has not made any public announcements so far, and rumors of the collapse of Washington are rife. The hopes of a nation, rest in the hands of Captains, who lie in the depths of the oceans, who remain our only hope to drag the Reds down to hell with us."
