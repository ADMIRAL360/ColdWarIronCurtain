Fat_Fucker.1.d:0 "The CIA director, Secretary of State, and top Agency operatives have developed a plan called Project FF, or Project Fat Fucker. The United States recognizes the current political organization in Egypt is unstable and heavily corrupt. If things continue, there is a high risk of a leftist revolution in the country. The plan calls for the CIA to approach King Farouk and put heavy pressure on him to initiate crucial reforms. Ultimately the goal is for the King to reform his government, spread royal authority to efficient ministers, curb corruption and offer a progressive vision for the Egyptian people. If the King refuses to change, then alternatives to his government must be considered, such as the Free Officers, a clandestine movement within armed forces of anti-royal officers interested in establishing a new, nationalist state."
Fat_Fucker.2.d:0 "The United States has approached the King and offered a dire warning. They claim if the current political situation continues, Egypt risks unrest and the overthrow of the monarchy. The Americans are insisting the King implement reforms, curb corruption, and assert his authority over the government. The reforms include giving royal authority to officials and military officers. The Americans essentially want the King to cut ties with some of his close friends, curtail some of his extracurricular interests, and establish a more progressive royal government under the guidance of trained bureaucrats and military officers. The King must decide to accept this pressure and risk his throne to foreign and domestic influence, or stay the course and maintain Egyptian sovereignty."
Fat_Fucker.3.d:0 "The King has acquiesced to American pressure on instituting critical reforms to his government and administration in order to prevent potential unrest or even uprisings. Close advisors to the King are drawing up the relevant orders and bringing in senior civil service and military officers for more prominent roles in the regime. However, although the King has agreed, it remains to be seen how deeply he will remain committed to these reforms. Regardless, the King claims he is acting in the best interests of the Egyptian people and the monarchy. Although the government media is publicizing a new initiative conceived by the King, there are already rumors across Egypt that the King is acting under American pressure. It appears some palace officials, conscious that the reforms will spell their decline, are openly spreading the word."
Fat_Fucker.4.d:0 "Project FF appears to be well on its way to success as King Farouk has indicated a willingness to agree with reforms. However, it is not the first time he has promised reforms but balked to go all the way. Regardless, the CIA and State Department are happy that the King was willing to accept our proposals in principle. The next stage will be to continue pressuring King Farouk until he implements all the reforms and establishes a secure, anti-communist, Egyptian state. Intelligence analysts argue we must continue the pressure on the King. There are fears however, that as word spreads that the King has agreed on reforms, which include giving more power to military officers, anti-royal nationalists in the military, may see this as an opportunity for their own agendas."
Fat_Fucker.5.d:0 "Our efforts to pressure King Farouk into initiating crucial reforms has failed. The King remains steadfast in his own delusions of grandeur and believes our advice is a ploy to establish American dominance in the country. Operation Ff appears to have failed to persuade the King, however, the objective to establish a strong, anti-communist Egyptian regime has not. The CIA has contacts with a group of nationalist, anti-royal military officers called the Free Officers. We can provide this group clandestine support and ensure their protection from counter-coups once they act against King Farouk. The President has directed the State Department and CIA to refocus its efforts on supporting the Free Officers to ensure when King Farouk inevitably falls, he will not be replaced by a leftist, pro-Moscow regime."
Project_FF.1.d:0 "The CIA has initiated an operation to spread information to the international press emphasizing the danger King Farouk of Egypt poses to the middle east. There are an increasing number of reports on Egypt discussing their desire to destroy Israel and rival Arab powers by any means necessary. Congressional allies, among other sources, have "leaked" specially curated intelligence reports suggesting Egypt is preparing to go bankrupt to acquire arms in order to launch attacks against neighboring states. Our agents in Egypt are spreading pamphlets and articles denouncing the corruption and moral bankruptcy of King Farouk in order to undermine his domestic base."
Project_FF.2.d:0 "There is increasing alarm across the United States and Europe over intelligence reports suggesting King Farouk of Egypt is preparing to launch military attacks against Israel and other neighboring states. The reports emphasize the delusional nature of Farouk and suggest he will take Egypt to bankruptcy in order to rapidly acquire arms to achieve his ambitions. Many American officials and their allies abroad note such a scenario is likely and renewed conflict in the region could result in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The Egyptian government denounces the accusations, accusing the West of launching a propaganda campaign against the Arab people."
