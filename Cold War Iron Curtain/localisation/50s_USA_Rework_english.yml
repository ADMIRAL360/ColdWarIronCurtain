Fat_Fucker.1.d:0 "The CIA director, Secretary of State, and top Agency operatives have developed a plan called Project FF, or Project Fat Fucker. The United States recognizes the current political organization in Egypt is unstable and heavily corrupt. If things continue, there is a high risk of a leftist revolution in the country. The plan calls for the CIA to approach King Farouk and put heavy pressure on him to initiate crucial reforms. Ultimately the goal is for the King to reform his government, spread royal authority to efficient ministers, curb corruption and offer a progressive vision for the Egyptian people. If the King refuses to change, then alternatives to his government must be considered, such as the Free Officers, a clandestine movement within armed forces of anti-royal officers interested in establishing a new, nationalist state."
Fat_Fucker.2.d:0 "The United States has approached the King and offered a dire warning. They claim if the current political situation continues, Egypt risks unrest and the overthrow of the monarchy. The Americans are insisting the King implement reforms, curb corruption, and assert his authority over the government. The reforms include giving royal authority to officials and military officers. The Americans essentially want the King to cut ties with some of his close friends, curtail some of his extracurricular interests, and establish a more progressive royal government under the guidance of trained bureaucrats and military officers. The King must decide to accept this pressure and risk his throne to foreign and domestic influence, or stay the course and maintain Egyptian sovereignty."
Fat_Fucker.3.d:0 "The King has acquiesced to American pressure on instituting critical reforms to his government and administration in order to prevent potential unrest or even uprisings. Close advisors to the King are drawing up the relevant orders and bringing in senior civil service and military officers for more prominent roles in the regime. However, although the King has agreed, it remains to be seen how deeply he will remain committed to these reforms. Regardless, the King claims he is acting in the best interests of the Egyptian people and the monarchy. Although the government media is publicizing a new initiative conceived by the King, there are already rumors across Egypt that the King is acting under American pressure. It appears some palace officials, conscious that the reforms will spell their decline, are openly spreading the word."
Fat_Fucker.4.d:0 "Project FF appears to be well on its way to success as King Farouk has indicated a willingness to agree with reforms. However, it is not the first time he has promised reforms but balked to go all the way. Regardless, the CIA and State Department are happy that the King was willing to accept our proposals in principle. The next stage will be to continue pressuring King Farouk until he implements all the reforms and establishes a secure, anti-communist, Egyptian state. Intelligence analysts argue we must continue the pressure on the King. There are fears however, that as word spreads that the King has agreed on reforms, which include giving more power to military officers, anti-royal nationalists in the military, may see this as an opportunity for their own agendas."
Fat_Fucker.5.d:0 "Our efforts to pressure King Farouk into initiating crucial reforms has failed. The King remains steadfast in his own delusions of grandeur and believes our advice is a ploy to establish American dominance in the country. Operation Ff appears to have failed to persuade the King, however, the objective to establish a strong, anti-communist Egyptian regime has not. The CIA has contacts with a group of nationalist, anti-royal military officers called the Free Officers. We can provide this group clandestine support and ensure their protection from counter-coups once they act against King Farouk. The President has directed the State Department and CIA to refocus its efforts on supporting the Free Officers to ensure when King Farouk inevitably falls, he will not be replaced by a leftist, pro-Moscow regime."
Project_FF.1.d:0 "The CIA has initiated an operation to spread information to the international press emphasizing the danger King Farouk of Egypt poses to the middle east. There are an increasing number of reports on Egypt discussing their desire to destroy Israel and rival Arab powers by any means necessary. Congressional allies, among other sources, have "leaked" specially curated intelligence reports suggesting Egypt is preparing to go bankrupt to acquire arms in order to launch attacks against neighboring states. Our agents in Egypt are spreading pamphlets and articles denouncing the corruption and moral bankruptcy of King Farouk in order to undermine his domestic base."
Project_FF.2.d:0 "There is increasing alarm across the United States and Europe over intelligence reports suggesting King Farouk of Egypt is preparing to launch military attacks against Israel and other neighboring states. The reports emphasize the delusional nature of Farouk and suggest he will take Egypt to bankruptcy in order to rapidly acquire arms to achieve his ambitions. Many American officials and their allies abroad note such a scenario is likely and renewed conflict in the region could result in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The Egyptian government denounces the accusations, accusing the West of launching a propaganda campaign against the Arab people."
US_Navy50s.1.d:0 "The United States Navy has held a series of high-level talks among senior officers and national defense leaders to articulate a more modern, proactive doctrine. The United States Navy believes it must deploy fleets across the oceans and position forces that can quickly arrive on the scene of any emerging international crisis. This will enable the United States more international maneuverability as it can quickly establish a forward presence and force projection. To better enact such a strategy, the Navy will required continued and extensive financial support from the government."
CIA_DOM_50s.1.d:0 "The CIA does not have domestic policing powers and is forbidden from spying on Americans at home. However, it does have a National Resources Division with a domestic focus. The NRD oversees several programs for voluntary debriefings of Americans in order to collect public intelligence and the Office of Current Intelligence which gives high-level briefings. However, the agency is rumored to be involved in other operations meant to experiment certain technologies, theories and efforts at influence public opinion. Such operations are critical in strengthening the capabilities of the agency in coming years, but the CIA plans on keeping its operations away from the public to avoid legal challenges."
CIA_DOM_50s.2.d:0 "Near the end of the war, our intelligence agencies discovered advanced and at times terrifying experiments by the Japanese and Germans involving the manipulation and control of the human mind. Many Nazis involved in such programs were arrested by our forces and after the war were employed to continue their studies. Our recent skirmishes with communist forces confirmed they were using their own techniques and experimenting on American prisoners of war. This is unacceptable and we cannot fall behind. As such, the Central Intelligence Agency recently launched Project MKUltra, which will experiment and study the use of specific drugs in order to improve interrogations and explore mind control. The CIA plans to launch tests on military personnel, employees, sex workers, prisoners, and mental patients in order to avoid public scrutiny as some Agency lawyers believe these experiments may violate laws regarding the CIA presence domestically."
CIA_DOM_50s.3.d:0 "Mass media is increasingly becoming a vital medium in how people across the globe consume news. The Soviets are already influencing and manipulating the media to further their political objectives and undermine the United States. To combat this foreign influence and subversion, the CIA recently initiated Operation Mockingbird. CIA agents are recruiting leading American journalists and influential civil groups in order to coordinate an effective response to the Soviet efforts. More importantly, the CIA can help propagate our own media offensives to better persuade the American and international community of our just cause and prevent the infiltration of foreign influence or American communists."
USA_Suez.5.d:0 "The London Stock Exchange has collapsed following news that the United States would begin calling in its war debt from the United Kingdom. This comes after the British government refused demands from Washington to halt its intervention in the Suez. The joint Anglo-French-Israeli invasion, launched after Egypt nationalized the Suez canal, caught the United States off guard. Many American leaders are likening the military action to colonial era gunboat diplomacy which has no role in the modern world and undermines the image of the West across the region. The decision to call in the war debt is leading to widespread panic across Britain, but it may be just the first action. If Britain continues the war, America may soon cut off economic aid, which would be disastrous to a nation still rebuilding from World War II."
USA_KOR_WITHDRAWAL.1.d:0 "The United States has begun withdrawing its forces from Korea. The President announced his decision after a high-level meeting with senior military and defense leaders. The President concluded that the American people had sacrificed and given all it could in supporting the cause of freedom in Korea. However, to stay on would be to sacrifice lives for no reasonable gain and it is time for the people of Korea to standup and fight for their own freedom. The news is being viewed as a fatal setback for the South Koreans and United Nations forces, as the loss of American forces now shift the balance of power noticeably to North Korea. The South Korean government and American allies have harshly criticized the American decision."
Formosa_Resolution.1.d:0 "The United States Senate passed a joint-resolution called the Formosa Resolution. It states that the President has the authority, at his discretion, to deploy the United States military to secure and protect Formosa (Taiwan) and its surrounding islands in response to any armed attacks by communists. The resolution is being celebrated across Taiwan as its people have long felt the threat of a mainland communist attack. The Taiwanese government pledged to remain steadfast in its defiance of the communists and thanked America for standing with the forces for a democratic China. The Peoples Republic of China condemned the resolution as the first step of America trying to turn Formosa into a colony and imperialist base to attack the revolution. Many Americans support the resolution as demonstrating the commitment of the United States to defend the global community from communism."
