The Igbos which originate in the south east are prominent entrepreneurs who are found in migrant communities throughout the country and due to their traditions in meritocratic societies aspire to rise through any system to the top. Hausa-Fulani are the largest of the three groups which come from the north west. Being from a traditional feudal islamic society, the Hausa-Fulani believe more so in an hierarchical structure where farmers and craftsmen feel content in a lower socio-economic position. This leads to the main culture clash as Hausa-Fulani obsess over Igbos trying to supersede them in their own workplace or education system. The Yoruba are a society famous for their sculptors, painters, and musicians which are always caught in between the tension of the Igbos and Hausa-Fulani."
