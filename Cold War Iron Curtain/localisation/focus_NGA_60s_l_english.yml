The Igbos which originate in the south east are prominent entrepreneurs who are found in migrant communities throughout the country and due to their traditions in meritocratic societies aspire to rise through any system to the top. Hausa-Fulani are the largest of the three groups which come from the north west. Being from a traditional feudal islamic society, the Hausa-Fulani believe more so in an hierarchical structure where farmers and craftsmen feel content in a lower socio-economic position. This leads to the main culture clash as Hausa-Fulani obsess over Igbos trying to supersede them in their own workplace or education system. The Yoruba are a society famous for their sculptors, painters, and musicians which are always caught in between the tension of the Igbos and Hausa-Fulani."

 nga60.1.d:0 "Uproars in the House of Assembly as Action Group's Yoruba Chief Obafemi Awolowo has been accused of trying to overthrow the government. Despite any solid evidence for this, Northerners feel Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa should instead make Ahmed Bello's ally Samuel Akintola the governor of the western region. The issue is of immediate importance to the Nigeria at the moment as rioting, banditry, and all acts of violence take place in the west as long as Obafemi Awolowo refuses to cooperate with the central government."
 nga60.4.d:0 "36 African nations boycott the 1966 FIFA world cup as FIFA insists on Aparthied South Africa's inclusion. Previously South Africa had been removed from the Confederation of African Football and in response FIFA has been continuously fining the CAF several thousand swiss Francs a year. In response the president of the Confederation of African Football, Yidnekatchew Tessema, stated "FIFA has adopted a relentless attitude against the African Associations and its decisions resemble methods of intimidation and repression designed to discourage any further impulses of a similar nature. In our opinion, the African National Associations… really deserved a gesture of respect rather than a fine.""
 nga60.5.d:0 "ANC leader Nelson Mandela has been called on trial today along with his comrades in a defense against the death penalty. The prosecution claims Nelson Mandela and the ANC have been attempting to over throw the government, while admitting to acts of sabotage the defense denies this. In a heroic and moving three hour speech, Nelson Mandela claims "I am prepared to die" as he brings his party's cause to the forefront of the media around the world. International outrage spreads across the world as student groups in London and the United Nations human rights committee call for the release of Nelson Mandela. In the end justice De Wet found Nelson Mandela and his fellow accused guilty of all four charges but declined the death penalty, instead giving a sentence of life in prison."
 nga60.6.d:0 "The Socialist Workers and Farmers Party of Nigeria, a Marxist-Leninist party has recently been founded by the trade unionist Tunji Otegbeye. Educated in London as a prominent speaker in the Students union Tunji Otegbeye made him self relevant in Nigeria's urban centers after he lead protests following the death of Patrice Lamumba. Directly aligning himself with Moscow, he wants to create an entirely orthodox marxist-leninist state in west africa which would participate in soviet research groups and COMECON"
 nga60.7.d:0 "This morning a group of five majors and other lower officers lead by Chukuma Kaduna Nzeogwu stormed the capital building and killed the main non-igbo figures of the government including Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Ahmadu Bello governor of the northern region, and Samuel Akintola governor of the western region. Following the death of many high ranking officers the coup plotters made a public statement that the coup was the result of clear and prevalent voter fraud by the northerner politicians of the country. Suspiciously major igbo politicians such as president Nnamdi Azikiwe were away or unharmed by the coup."
 nga60.8.d:0 "In an attempt to quell northern unrest and conspiracy theories that the Coup of the Five Majors was an inside plot by the Igbo military establishment, Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi has decided to free the northern military prisoners that were arrested during the previous coup. However, many advisors of the General are telling him that doing so would surely allow them to wage a counter-coup. The question still is to be decided..."
 nga60.9.d:0 "Rumors of the Coup of the Five Majors being an inside plot to justify Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi and other igbos coming to power are now upheld as articles of faith by the northerners in the armed forces and all over the country. In response a series of northern officers lead by Murtala Muhammad and Olusegun Obasanjo are attempting a counter-coup against Aguiyi-Ironsi as we speak."
 nga60.11.d:0 "Only being independent for five years, today ends Nigeria's infant republic. Ever since its first general election in 1961, the southern igbo ethnic group has felt that the government of their nation was overly northern lead and in response a group of majors and low level officers of igbo descent have committed a violent coup which resulted in the death of the leading establishment of the west african republic. While the world is still waiting for news from these usurpers people across the globe can only sit and wonder what will happen to one of the worlds youngest nation..."
 nga60.12.d:0 "While the initial coup of the five majors in Nigeria was put down by the respected general Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, he was interestingly enough also of Igbo descent. Conspiracy theories quickly spread that this initial plot was a false flag for the purpose of justifying a legitimate Igbo take over in the government. Northerns quickly held on to this idea as if it was gospel truth until a new batch of more skilled officers from the northern provinces committed a successful counter-coup against Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi and his comrades. In the aftershocks of this crisis, widespread pogroms against ethnic Igbos are flaring up all over the northern part of the country leading to a mass flight of refugees returning to their native south eastern region."
 nga60.13.d:0 "Tunji Otegbeye's Socialist Workers and Farmers Party of Nigeria though only founded a few years ago has managed to infiltrate a sizable group of university educated young officers who were a part of his student movements and protests. With the right level of luck and precise planning and thanks to soviet connections, a precise coup was made involving the murder of Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. While only the government buildings in Kaduna and Lagos were effectively captured the lack of any current junta leadership has allowed the Nigerian Liberation Army to begin asserting control over the nation. Claiming that the party will bring an end to ethnic conflict in Nigeria by establishing a Marxist-Leninist state many Nigerians are becoming sympathetic to the cause, especially among labor union circles."
 nga60.14.d:0 "The Nigerian general election is coming up and two main parties are coming to the for front in popularity. The first is the well established big tent party composing Pan-Africanists, Social Democrats, and some more moderate Social-Liberal elements, the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons lead by Nnamdi Azikiwe. Secondly we have the underdog party - the Kemalist Dynamic Party. One of the first parties to have a formal manifesto, it is lead by mathematician-scholar Chike Obi; the party claims to follow a path of westernization and modernization. Their main foreign policy goals are a West African Federation, an African Monroe Doctrine, and an alliance with India against South Africa."
 nga60.15.d:0 "With the Biafran oil rights in mind France is planning to give us some much needed military support in our war against the north. Despite much criticism that this will lead to us losing access to our own, others say this deal is merely symbolic and won't require much follow through on our end."
 nga60.16.d:0 "The god Babalú-Aye or Obaluaye, is the yoruba deity of smallpox and healing of disease. Among those that worship him there is in general a disregard or even opposition to western medication which is holding back the health of those in rural communities. Some practitioners have even prevented local vaccination programs for smallpox believing it will anger their god. In response the NCNC administration is attempting to bring teachers and protestant missionaries to the region to diminish this cult."
 nga60.17.d:0 "Our wise president Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe has brought together the diverse ethnic groups of Nigeria for a common cause, erasing the divisions between the three main people of the country. A fluent speaker of Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa the multicultural articulate leader has been able to address the grievances of each group which have been explained as originating from decades of colonial exploitation. The British divide and conquer scheme had greatly scarred the former colony as they attempted to use the authoritarian feudal north to enforce rule over the non-hierarchical south. However in the past few years, Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbos are starting to no longer identify as their ethnic term but rather simply as a Nigerian. Perhaps pan-africanism really has been achieved..."
 nga60.18.d:0 "Through mutual interest and some cunning diplomacy, Chike Obi along with his like minded equivalents in Ghana, Upper Volta, Togo, and Niger have come together to create what is perhaps the biggest step yet taken in pan-africanism. The declaration of the West African federation is now official with the full integration taking place in the following weeks. This however is not entirely a shock to our state systems due to extensive planning which took place in the previous months, which will soften the long road ahead of us for achieving a fully functioning federal state. There are more complicated talks however about our internal plans with aligning other west african nations into our federation."
 nga60.19.d:0 "With the official establishment of the West African Federation its now time to decide what the capital of the new nation should be as many find Lagos to be too Nigerian Centric"
 nga60.20.d:0 "Pan-Africanism's victory appears right before the world as the Nigerian African Kemalist Chike Obi's extended political talks with Kwame Nkrumah and others have finally resulted in the integration of several West African States into the new loose federation. The plan first proposed in Obi's political manifesto of his Dynamic Party has had a long road reaching this point, which is seen in the many compromises he had to make in the governance and autonomy of the new country. Critics and skeptics outside of Africa however are only asking two things; is it sustainable and will this model expand to other countries?"
 nga60.21.d:0 "As one of the cores of the party manifesto from Chike Obi, our nation has diplomatically established what he calls a "West African Monroe Doctrine" which is an international claim that an attack on any independent African state is an attack on the West African Federation."
 nga60.22.d:0 "Inspired by the American Monroe Doctrine, the West African Federation has made the announcement that any new attempt of colonialism or violation of African sovereignty will be taken as an act of war against the Federation. Tensions with South Africa and Portugal in mind, geopolitical exports watch nervously as to where the rising African power will be asserting its influence."
 nga60.23.d:0 "As part of a Moscow backed coup, Tunji Otegbeye's Socialist Workers and Farmers Party of Nigeria has come to power in Nigeria. Recognized as part of the traditional Old Left, Otegbeye had established himself long before the founding of his party through being a very successful trade union and student protest organizer and now finds himself taking over the administration of a transitionary government. For the next few years the nation will be under martial law from the Nigerian Liberation army (Newly formed red guard style militias) as authority is asserted throughout the nation. Once national security is achieved Otegbeye has a multi point plan in which he claims through a dialectical understanding of the world that Nigerians will no longer experience the issues of the ethnic infighting which have plagued the nation since its early colonial days."
 nga60.24.d:0 "Today Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi announced the beginning of a justified liberation of Ambazonia. The border between Nigeria and Cameroon was originally a part of the single British Cameroon Mandate from end of World War One, with the north going to Nigeria and the south going to Cameroon. During plans for independence the English speaking region attempted to join Nigeria or possibly become independent under the Republic of Ambazonia, however following a plebiscite in 1961 this goal was gone with UN creating an autonomous state inside French Cameroon instead."
 nga60.25.d:0 "Following a successful campaign against Mali we have been able to reassert control of the nation under Modibo Keïta. With the new alignment to our control, it will now be up our diplomats to negotiate their entry into the West African Federation."
 nga60.26.d:0 "Ever since the 1968 Coup against the Pan-Africanist Modibo Keïta has our foreign policy against Mali been hostile. However with agreements made with the previous leader to restore his regime, the West African Federation is prepared to fight a conventional war against Mali in attempt to bring the nation close towards our Pan-Africanist goal. Officially today Chike Obi has announced a formal declaration of war which has taken a mixed response around the world with France claiming they will back the current Malian regime."
 nga60.28.d:0 "In response to growing tension between C. Odumegwu Ojukwu and [NGA.GetLeader], [GHA.GetLeader] is hosting an internationally observed assembly to come to agreement over the south eastern region's tension. Wanting to avoid a crisis involving the succession of the oil rich region of Biafra, [NGA.GetLeader] is hearing out every request made by C. Odumegwu Ojukwu who has responded openly and positively to the talks made in the friendly and professional setting. C. Odumegwu Ojukwu is seeking the transition of Nigeria into a loose confederation with large amounts of regional autonomy, while [NGA.GetLeader] simply wants the head of state to simultaneously be the head of the armed forces as his end of the deal. In the end however, it seems every proposal made by Ojukwu will be unanimously adopted and military force will not be used in Nigeria under any circumstances."
 nga60.29.d:0 "Regardless of previous conceptions, the agreements of the Aburi Accords have completely fallen apart. As soon as the meetings in Aburi ended there was immediate backtracking on the part of [NGA.GetLeader], with the Igbo states being divided such that the the governorship of Ojukwu would no longer have control of the oil rights in the south east, as the extraction center would be moved into non-Igbo majority states. With anti-Igbo pogroms on the rise and a clear disregard from the national government, Ojukwu has made a call for all Igbos to come back to their ancestral homeland in the south east. If this didn't make their succession a clear certainty it was a plane crash in Enugu carrying guns from national stockpiles secretly to the region. It will be no doubt, any day now, before the South East declares their independence..."
 nga60.30.d:0 "Despite an attempted negotiation in Aburi Ghana between Biafra's regional governor C. Odumegwu Ojukwu and [NGA.GetLeader], all agreements have been reneged upon leaving disgruntled Ojukwu feeling no option but succession. Ever since the Nigerian Coup of the Five Majors, there have been northerner lead pogroms against the ethnic Igbo who originate from the south eastern region. Biafra, being an oil rich and population dense region of Nigeria feels its people gain no advantage from being a part of national Nigerian government and now president C. Odumegwu Ojukwu believes the nation can sustain itself independently. When asked about fear of an attempt of the Nigerian Armed Forces to reassert control over the region, Ojukwu assured the lack of any organized command structure and battle experience of the nation's young military will be the death of it."
 nga60.31.d:0 "Given the situation, [NGA.GetLeader] has clearly done every politically feasible action he could in following through with the Aburi Accords but in the end, C. Odumegwu Ojukwu's unreasonable nature has resulted in a horrible crisis. To our advantage however is the lack of equipment and funds of the Biafran secessionist state, many in our military staff believe the war will be over in a matter of a few weeks. Regardless we should still be cautious despite the weakness of our enemy as we still do not possess a well organized army and will need some time to make a solid military plan. It is time to project internal security and take back control of the south east of our country!"
 nga60.32.d:0 "The Delta Volunteer Army has just declared an independent Niger Delta Republic under the leadership of the young Army Major, Police Officer, Teacher, University Student, and Political Activist Isaac Adaka Boro. Boro coming from the Ijaw ethnic group feels that the Delta State being one of the main sources of FOil for Nigeria is profited by only Igbos, Hausas, and Yorubans. Announcing the revolution he stated "Today is a great day, not only in your lives but also in the history of the Niger Delta. Perhaps, it will be the greatest day for a very long time. This is not because we are going to bring the heavens down, but because we are going to demonstrate to the world what and how we feel about oppression. Remember your 70-year-old grandmother who still farms before she eats; remember also your poverty-stricken people; remember, too, your petroleum which is being pumped out daily from your veins; and then fight for your freedom.""
 nga60.33.d:0 "Ever since Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi put down the coup of the five majors, the common belief among northerners was that the recent events of Nigeria have been taken control of by a conspiracy of Igbos wishing to monopolize the power in the country. Even before the failed Northern Counter-Coup there were plans for the north to succeed. This in mind, many of the northern dominant general staff have been heard mentioning the benefits of an independent muslim dominant hausaland which would no longer be interfered with by Igbos. While this would likely lead to all out civil war, we can not trust that these figures in the military wouldn't consider going to that length with tensions these high."
 nga60.34.d:0 "As some saw coming a major part of the Nigerian general staff have returned to their homeland in the north where they have organized a military insurrection lead under general Murtala Mohammed. However many northerners have chosen to stay in our nation whether it be for religious or political reasons and we can expect to hold our own with the sizable military staff that we have maintained. Likely what will become of the Hausaland army is that it will go on a defensive role attempting to draw out our resources in the deserts and mountains of that region of the country. However if we can focus on long term embargos, bombing runs, and artillery strikes, we will surely bring the traitors into submission."
 nga60.35.d:0 "Ethnic conflict in Nigeria has escalated into a tragic crisis. Haile Selassie in his continued quest of being an active participant in positive African foreign policy believes he can negotiate an end to this crisis by finding a mutually beneficial agreement between the Biafran secessionists and the Nigerian northerner lead government."
 nga60.36.d:0 "The severe nature of our situation with the Biafran succession has obviously not gone unnoticed by world leaders. Ethiopia's Emperor, Haile Selassie is attempting to host peace negotiations in his neutral nation between C. Odumegwu Ojukwu and [NGA.GetLeader] per usual of his reputation as an inter-African organizer for justice and cordial diplomacy. However clearly the talks are not going anywhere as it seems Ojukwu is not going to settle for anything less than full autonomy and independence of Biafra from Nigeria. With weeks going by and the war being costly, we have to trigger our nuclear option: complete blockade. Surely the Biafrans will not sit and starve themselves when submission is possible."
 nga60.37.d:0 "Despite us trying to make peace with Nigeria in the recent meetings in Ethiopia, they have decided to go all out with their cruelist of options as they can not defeat us militarily. By blockading our ports and preventing any weapons, supply, or food from being imported they believe they can put an end to our brave republic. If we do not turn the tide of the war soon or the international community does not intervene, we may see unimaginable suffering."
 nga60.38.d:0 "Unable to experience anymore major combat success, the Nigerian Federal Army has decided to begin an entire blockade of the Biafran secessionist Republic. All across the world to millions of television viewers are tragic, horrid, and traumatic photographs and film of thousands of children and infants starving to death in the south eastern region of Nigeria. This event has created dozens of new NGOs around the world organized around famine prevention, one of the first acts of these groups being the attempt of the world's largest airlift which aims to be more extensive and on a larger scale than even the previous Berlin Airlift. Despite international outrage the United Nations and the major countries of the world have refused to intervene diplomatically in the conflict and Nigeria's Federal Army leadership has stated "Starvation is a legitimate weapon of war, and we have every intention of using it.""
 nga60.39.d:0 "The Nigerian Federal Army since the dawn of the war has been under the assumption that Enugu, the capital of Biafra, being the heart of secessionist sentiment, would cause the end of the war when taken. However this preconceived notion may have been naive as after taking the city resistance continued within it and around the frontlines with Biafra. In a moment of frustration with further progress in the war being halted in the city, General Murtala Mohammed lead his men in an organized and systematic massacre of over 700 civilians in an attempt to lower enemy morale. Little attempt was made to hide this as the General is hoping news of this event will spread fear throughout the country but others in our government believe this may hurt our international image."
 nga60.40.d:0 "Originally when Murtala Mohammed, Babafemi Ogundipe, Robert Adebayo and others created the Supreme Military Council they intended that their junta would lead the northern region into succession from the Nigerian state but when various government officials and foreign diplomats from the USA and United Kingdom (with their oil rights in the bay of Biafra in mind) convinced them otherwise, the conspirators had to change the pace of their plans. Due to the extreme ethnic tension in Nigeria the junta leaders decided to find the candidate who would be the least controversial, to them this would be Yakubu Gowon. Given a lack of any involvement in politics by the Colonel, along with him not being Hausa, Fulani, or even a Muslim but still a northerner makes him a comfortable choice to be selected as head of state."
 nga60.41.d:0 "Yakubu Gowon has realized that in a situation we have found ourselves in where Nigeria is to be a single federal state, that there will still be a need to check the influence of Western and Eastern Governors. To prevent a situation like the Western Crisis or War in Biafra from taking place again we will be dividing the southern and western regions into subdivisions that will leave resources and population centers in divisions that are not majority Igbo or Yoruba people as the minority ethnicities are far more cooperative and supportive of the federal government."
 nga60.42.d:0 "With the surrender of the Republic of Biafran having been accepted, Yakubu Gowon decided to make a speech on the main rebel radio station of the republic, Radio Biafra. On the network he gave a speech which was characterized by the repeating statement "No Victor, No Vanquished" where he promised a policy of "Reconciliation, Reconstruction, and Rehabilitation" in which he will give amnesty to almost all who fought in the war, give $20 to every citizen of Biafra who had a Nigerian bank account, and begin a repair and development program in the region. Despite these promises, the average citizen of the south east couldn't be any less enthusiastic or optimistic as the claims sound fanciful to the normal victim of the war."
 nga60.43.d:0 "With the loss of the two major cities of the Republic of Biafra, the president C. Odumegwu Ojukwu fled by plane to the Ivory Coast while Philip Effiong was left to pick up the pieces. In the following hours Effiong agreed to give the formal surrender of the Republic of Biafra to Yakubu Gowon and agree to the full annexation of Biafra. Giving the letter to General Olusegun Obasanjo on the frontlines, fighting would still take several days to end as news did not yet reach the militias fighting in the inner parts of the country."
 nga60.44.d:0 "After the major population centers of Hausaland were taken fighting felt more and more futile for the people of the region. Earlier this week Murtala Mohammed fled across the border into the ethnic Hausa region of Niger where he attempted to rally a base there to no avail. The severity of this situation lead to an attempted coup of Hassan Katsina and then the eventual collapse of an organized government. [NGA.GetLeader] waited as a peace deal from Hassan Katsina arrived agreeing to a full annexation and renouncement of succession which was readily accepted, though fighting would continue in rural regions for several days."
 nga60.45.d:0 "In a counter attack by Biafran commandos earlier an Italian oil complex was taken control of with many low level workers being killed and a group of European expat workers taken hostage. Those in captivity of which included 14 Italians, 3 West Germans and one Lebanese were initially sentenced to death for aiding the Nigerian enemy state through construction of infrastructure. However there has been a massive uproar with the western nations which already were quite hostile to Biafra, now the United States and United Kingdom are choosing an even more aggressive approach with Baifra following this event. Even the Pope, Paul VI was sending direct mail to Ojukwu which eventually convinced the leader to pardon the prisoners."
 nga60.46.d:0 "Following the loss of the capital of Biafra, Enugu, the rebellion's leader C. Odumegwu Ojukwu escaped capture to the friendly nation of the Ivory Coast. With a peace deal arriving from second in command, Phillip Effiong thus ended the most bloody conflict in African history. With the infrastructure of the region entirely destroyed and mass famines still continuing it will be a difficult process to cause a genuine feeling of reconciliation among the victims of this war. Talks of pardoning the majority of those in Biafra who fought in the war are being spread about as propaganda for the leniency of the government when the dozens of war criminals responsible for the blockade which killed more than eight thousand people a day won't even stand a trial either..."
 nga60.47.d:0 "With the 'Niger Delta Republic' utterly crushed the small group of rebel leaders under Isaac Adaka Boro which made up the Delta Volunteer Army were arrested and imprisoned for sedition. However Yakubu Gowon wanting to ease ethnic tension in the nation has decided to pardon Boro, following which he immediately rejoined the Nigerian Federal Army command. With the nation on the verge of civil war, perhaps he can help us on the frontlines by recruiting Delta State volunteers and keeping their morale high. " 
 nga60.48.d:0 "Isaac Adaka Boro's elite marine commando division, the 'Sea School Boys' have been instrumental in the Nigerian Civil War as their knowledge of the river systems, their understanding of the various local languages, and their expert survival skills allowing them to live off the land have all made them incredibly successful. However unexpectedly their leader Boro was killed, leaving the division in an uncontrollable state, roaming in chaos, and having to be dissolved. There are two accounts of what happened. The official story is that while securing a Biafran stronghold, a loose rebel shot and killed him with his division then erupting in random violence. However a second account was heard by a soldier swearing on the Ijaw gods that Boro was not killed by a rebel. He claims that the sector was already stable and secured and that in an unexpected moment when the men were resting that Benjamin 'Black Scorpion' Adekunle's Special Forces ambushed the soldiers and killed Boro then and there."
 nga60.49.d:0 "This week in a pleasant ceremony Christopher Welby-Everard transferred over leadership of the Nigerian Armed Forces to now Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. Throughout the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria's history there was a prominent issue of an overly British dominant military command which lead to many lower level officers having to be promoted on independence. Because of this, many British staff were left in military positions for months after independence as it took time for their appropriate replacements with Christopher Welby-Everard staying as the last British Commander in Nigeria until this year, leaving a now entirely Africanized military. "
 nga60.50.d:0 "A student group lead by socialist Tunji Otegbeye has stormed the house of representatives in a protest against the Anglo-Nigerian Defense Pact. Otegbeye and the students believe that the defense pact is a continuation of British Colonialism and violates the sovereignty of Nigeria by involving a neutral nation into the cold war power struggle of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Tunji Otegbeye as a Marxist-Leninist takes this even farther, believing that by helping the United Kingdom against the USSR it is aiding and abetting the oppression of workers internationally. In response Tunji Otegbeye as the chief organizer was arrested and imprisoned along with several other comrades, however the next day they were released."
 nga60.51.d:0 "Ever since his time as a commander, Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi has been characterized by his swagger stick with a stuffed crocodile mascot of which he affectionately dubs "Charlie". Legends from his soldiers surround the mascot, many believers in traditional folk religions see it as a fetish, or an item that has mystical and spiritual powers. The legends state that Johnson Aguiyi Ironsi had used the staff to block bullets in the Congo on multiple occasions, that retrieving it from his car during an operation in the Hausaland war lead to him avoiding an artillery strike, and most importantly that it was with him during the attempted northern counter-coup. Despite these claims, Johnson Aguiyi Ironsi is not a fetishist but a devout catholic and assures his men that the swagger stick is just a staff and nothing more."
 nga60.52.d:0 "To the credit of our excellent planning, when we executed our northern lead counter-coup Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi was already in the hands of Theophilus Danjuma before he was aware of what was happening. After his arrest, things began to escalate when he was tied up. Being interrogated with his ally Adekunle Fajuyi and his ADC Andrew Nwankwo being held hostage near him, he was repeatedly asked about his involvement in the coup of the five majors. With Aguiyi-Ironsi insisting he knew nothing about the uprising's planning and that he only intervened to bring back stability, his captors became impatient resulting in Danjuma's men beating him unconscious. Eventually with little interest in a trial or conviction Danjuma formed a firing squad which killed Aguiyi-Ironsi and Fajuyi with Andrew Nwankwo escaping into the bush."
 nga60.53.d:0 "Today officially Tunji Otegbeye announces the abolishment of Sharia courts, the unrecognition of Qadi's as legal authority, and the beginning of a propaganda campaign to dissuade all forms of Islamic law. While Nigeria is a religiously diverse nation with Sunnis, Catholics, Protestants, and dozens of traditional beliefs Tunji believes that focusing on reducing the influence of Islam should come first as it is the backbone to the power of the northern feudal nobility. This initiative has not gone over without opposition however, which is why Nigerian Liberation Army soldiers are present in the forceful abolishment of Sharia courts and the will be supervising legal practices throughout the northern regions."
 nga60.54.d:0 "Feudalism has existed for almost a millennia in Nigeria and its grasp on the illiterate, hungary peasantry of the nation is undeniable. Executed like a precise military action, Nigerian Liberation Army soldiers with caravans of student teachers follow extended routes along the rural countryside of northern Nigeria confronting one estate after another where peasantry are redistributed property from their nobles and are educated in how they must work towards the revolution and give no recognition of authority to their previous landlords. In some circumstances however nobility have convinced their illiterate peasantry that the Nigerian Liberation Army will kill them and destroy their villages leading to small levies fighting in short skirmishes. In every instance of this however, the morale of the serf levies is very low and early on the NLA is able to negotiate an end to the situation with very few people dying."
 nga60.55.d:0 "Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi is planning the construction of a new parliament and presidential palace (to which he is neither the prime minister or president technically) in Port Harcourt. Aguiyi-Ironsi believes that Lagos as a capital is too representing of the colonial legacy of Nigeria as the city with its Portuguese name has always been the center of British colonial dominance in the region. By establishing a capital in a new city center under construction in the Igbo heartland of Port Harcourt, Aguiyi-Ironsi is attempting to set a vision of a new era for an independent Nigeria."
 nga60.56.d:0 "In a ceremony inspired by Mao's declaration of the People's Republic, Tunji Otegbeye stood out in the main square of Lagos on a stand surrounded by armed guards in front of a crowd which filled the streets for hundreds of meters away. Many people cheered, others stayed silent with some people showing expressions of pure joy while others scowled at their leader. In his speech Tunji started with speaking out against the landlords, reactionaries, and other enemies of the state after which he announced the beginning of a new era for not just Nigeria but all of Africa as the world revolution will one day be achieved by the combined effort of the workers and farmers of the nation towards a single cause. But it will be radical he insists and there will be a need to fully recreate the entire identity of the nation... "
 nga60.57.d:0 "Many of the cities of Nigeria carry over colonial names from the British and other European colonizers. Lagos for instance is the Portuguese word for lakes, while Port Harcourt speaks for itself. So the question that gets asked when it comes to renaming the cities of Nigeria is whether we should change them to native names or rename them after socialist and pan-africanist figures?"
 nga60.58.d:0 "In the first step to revolutionizing the country the plan to change the capital is first at question. Lagos being the colonial center of the previous colony and protectorate of Nigeria gives it a negative connotation as a capital and its location is very inconvenient for governance. The choice for a new capital should be in a central location and not in a place where one major ethnicity has disproportionate dominance."
 nga60.59.d:0 "Though there have been intense protests all over the globe following the murder of Patrice Lamumba, things have gotten especially intense here in Nigeria. A large section of the financial district of Lagos has been burned down in a large scale riot involving thousands of students from all over the country, all lead under no other than the Marxist doctor Tunji Otegbeye. While Otegbeye has continuously created trouble in the nation, his place of significance means that chaos could ensue if too strict of measures are taken against him, so in response the federal police decided to arrest and detain him and his colleagues for only a few months."
 nga60.60.d:0 "With the only uprising planned by Nzeogwu succeeding being in Kaduna, it became clear early on to the leader of the Armed Forces Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi that Nzeogwu's next course of action would have to be trying to seize control of the federal capital of Lagos. With this in mind Aguiyi-Ironsi was able to send Colonel Conrad Nwawo, a man which Nzeogwu heavily respected to intercept him and negotiate as proxy. Aguiyi-Ironsi had told Conrad Nwawo to assure Nzeogwu that he would not be punished if he was to surrender which Nzeogwu began to believe was his best option as he realized how futile attacking the now well defended federal capital would be. With Nzeogwu's surrender and the prime minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa dead, Aguiyi-Ironsi tried to convince the president Nnamdi Azikiwe to take over as head of state. However when Azikiwe refused due to the optics of him as an Igbo being handed leadership of the country by a fellow Igbo following a coup, matters were left in Aguiyi-Ironsi's hands..."
 nga60.61.d:0 "After the extensive West African congress our government has come to agreement with the other nations of the assembly. It is time to begin integration."
 nga60.62.d:0 "The first question to be asked in the congress is how should our new government be structured and how should it function. The nations involved in West Africa come from different colonial empires and as such all had different ways of achieving decolonization. The ideological differences between Nkrumah and Obi are yet too be discussed as it would likely bog down the entire congress, instead there is today only a focus on simple structural decisions of the government's legislative branch. How will it be structured?"
 nga60.63.d:0 "Today's congress has erupted into a shouting match between Kwame Nkrumah and his ally Ahmed Sékou Touré against Chike Obi. While most political matters were swept aside between them and simply fell by the wayside the one strongly contested position between the two is the nation's budget allocation. With the vast resources and population of the new nation Kwame Nkrumah and Ahmed Sékou Touré want to focus the nation's economy on public infrastructure, social development, and education while Chike Obi does believe in this, he wants to focus a large portion of the budget on military buildup as to have a formidable army which can defend all of Africa from imperialism. Arguing that the new country will be able to have indigenous military technology on par with European nations, he believes it will require a massive amount of student engineers and scientist being state mandated to do military research. Neither seems budging on the issue what should we do?"
 nga60.64.d:0 "Even since the time before Marcus Garvey Africans have seen their shared struggle of oppression from foreign imperialism and wished for a unity and strength through the great ingenuity and bravery of the African People. With Nkrumah and Touré's Union of African States failing in 1963 it seemed that an idea of unified African federation in West Africa was never coming into be. This has changed with the dynamic party coming to power in Nigeria as Chike Obi is ready to establish a federation with like minded leaders in the region as a main focus of his administration. Beginning over the course of the next few days will be a congress with various representatives of West African nations coming together for one cause."
 nga60.65.d:0 "Inspired by the same decision made by Kemal Atatürk, Chike Obi has formally banned all public wearing of the Hijab or other such Islamic headwear. Relating the dominance of Islamic feudal elite in Nigeria to the fundamentalists in the ex-Ottoman Empire, Chike Obi made a televised speech to the nation in which he made it clear that such customs are antiquated relics of the past that any modernizing nation should dispose of. While this will be hard to enforce and the still existing influence of Islamic culture in Nigeria will create backlash to this decision, Obi is not accepting any criticism for this decision."
 nga60.66.d:0 "Yoruba tribal marks date back at least a thousands years and have been always a major factor in the hierarchy of Yoruban societies as they signify clan affiliation and those without them in their society entirely ostracized and unable to preform any meaningful interaction with others. Performed at a young age with sharp burning instruments, the scarring is normally in the series of 4-15 marks on the face for men and several dozen on the breasts or buttocks for women. Often the practice can lead to infection or in some circumstances unintended deformities. In Chike Obi's plan of complete modernization and westernization of the country he wishes to not only completely abolish this practice, but also the ancient societal constructs which make this practice necessary."
 nga60.67.d:0 "Female Genital Mutilation is a practice thousands of years old which transcends religion and ethnicity all throughout West Africa. In Nigeria to the surprise of some, the highest propensity of the practice is in the christian and traditional beliefs following south. There almost half of the girls and women experience female circumcision, a practice which is intended to remove the labia from women at a young age to prevent any pleasure from sex for spiritual reasons. The practice can lead to many health issues and even later in life can result to fatal problems when giving birth. Chike Obi has repeatedly spoken out against this practice and will create a nation wide information campaign to reduce this practice as well as enforcing legal penalties of up to five years in prison for those who practice this act."
 nga60.68.d:0 "In a new bill that is being sponsored through the Parliament by Nnamdi Azikiwe which will strengthen and protect workers rights to organize, there is a lot of attention being raised by the major labor organizer, Tunji Otegbeye. Otegbeye is demanding extra additions to the bill which will prevent strike breaking and firing workers on strikes. This extra step might make the bill too controversial and not be able to pass. What should we do?"
 nga60.69.d:0 "All throughout Lagos textile factories are large scale strikes which were organized by Tunji Otegbeye. The scale and intensity have prevented any intervention by the authorities and while we won't change the bill we will have to make some empty promises and wait for this to blow over."
 nga60.70.d:0 "When militarism is introduced to politics it is always almost impossible to remove. The story of so many nation's early democracies are ended in such a way with one single coup or punsch. Following such an event the military will always feel it has the ability to take control of the government if they feel it is not in their interest, it is such a tradition which can not be undone. At least that is the norm and what we are to believe but perhaps Zik and the NCNC can make a different future for us than that. With the stability of the country through Zik's reforms we can reach a level where such an event as a later coup would be seen as a moral and societal impossibility. We will have a steady and permanent lasting democracy and nothing will stop us!"
