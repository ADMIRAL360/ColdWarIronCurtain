 nga60.1.d:0 "Uproars in the House of Assembly as Action Group's Yoruba Chief Obafemi Awolowo has been accused of trying to overthrow the government. Despite any solid evidence for this, Northerners feel Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa should instead make Ahmed Bello's ally Samuel Akintola the governor of the western region. The issue is of immediate importance to the Nigeria at the moment as rioting, banditry, and all acts of violence take place in the west as long as Obafemi Awolowo refuses to cooperate with the central government."
 nga60.4.d:0 "36 African nations boycott the 1966 FIFA world cup as FIFA insists on Aparthied South Africa's inclusion. Previously South Africa had been removed from the Confederation of African Football and in response FIFA has been continuously fining the CAF several thousand swiss Francs a year. In response the president of the Confederation of African Football, Yidnekatchew Tessema, stated "FIFA has adopted a relentless attitude against the African Associations and its decisions resemble methods of intimidation and repression designed to discourage any further impulses of a similar nature. In our opinion, the African National Associations… really deserved a gesture of respect rather than a fine.""
 nga60.5.d:0 "ANC leader Nelson Mandela has been called on trial today along with his comrades in a defense against the death penalty. The prosecution claims Nelson Mandela and the ANC have been attempting to over throw the government, while admitting to acts of sabotage the defense denies this. In a heroic and moving three hour speech, Nelson Mandela claims "I am prepared to die" as he brings his party's cause to the forefront of the media around the world. International outrage spreads across the world as student groups in London and the United Nations human rights committee call for the release of Nelson Mandela. In the end justice De Wet found Nelson Mandela and his fellow accused guilty of all four charges but declined the death penalty, instead giving a sentence of life in prison."
 nga60.6.d:0 "The Socialist Workers and Farmers Party of Nigeria, a Marxist-Leninist party has recently been founded by the trade unionist Tunji Otegbeye. Educated in London as a prominent speaker in the Students union Tunji Otegbeye made him self relevant in Nigeria's urban centers after he lead protests following the death of Patrice Lamumba. Directly aligning himself with Moscow, he wants to create an entirely orthodox marxist-leninist state in west africa which would participate in soviet research groups and COMECON"
 nga60.7.d:0 "This morning a group of five majors and other lower officers lead by Chukuma Kaduna Nzeogwu stormed the capital building and killed the main non-igbo figures of the government including Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Ahmadu Bello governor of the northern region, and Samuel Akintola governor of the western region. Following the death of many high ranking officers the coup plotters made a public statement that the coup was the result of clear and prevalent voter fraud by the northerner politicians of the country. Suspiciously major igbo politicians such as president Nnamdi Azikiwe were away or unharmed by the coup."
 nga60.8.d:0 "In an attempt to quell northern unrest and conspiracy theories that the Coup of the Five Majors was an inside plot by the Igbo military establishment, Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi has decided to free the northern military prisoners that were arrested during the previous coup. However, many advisors of the General are telling him that doing so would surely allow them to wage a counter-coup. The question still is to be decided..."
 nga60.9.d:0 "Rumors of the Coup of the Five Majors being an inside plot to justify Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi and other igbos coming to power are now upheld as articles of faith by the northerners in the armed forces and all over the country. In response a series of northern officers are attempting a counter-coup against Aguiyi-Ironsi as we speak."
 nga60.11.d:0 "Only being independent for five years, today ends Nigeria's infant republic. Ever since its first general election in 1961, the southern igbo ethnic group has felt that the government of their nation was overly northern lead and in response a group of majors and low level officers of igbo descent have committed a violent coup which resulted in the death of the leading establishment of the west african republic. While the world is still waiting for news from these usurpers people across the globe can only sit and wonder what will happen to one of the worlds youngest nation..."
 nga60.12.d:0 "While the initial coup of the five majors in Nigeria was put down by the respected general Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, he was interestingly enough also of Igbo descent. Conspiracy theories quickly spread that this initial plot was a false flag for the purpose of justifying a legitimate Igbo take over in the government. Northerns quickly held on to this idea as if it was gospel truth until a new batch of more skilled officers from the northern provinces committed a successful counter-coup against Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi and his comrades. In the aftershocks of this crisis, widespread pogroms against ethnic Igbos are flaring up all over the northern part of the country leading to a mass flight of refugees returning to their native south eastern region."
 nga60.13.d:0 "Tunji Otegbeye's Socialist Workers and Farmers Party of Nigeria though only founded a few years ago has managed to infiltrate a small group of young officers and with the right level of luck and precise planning thanks to soviet connections, have managed to seize control of the Northern lead junta. Claiming that the party will bring an end to ethnic conflict in Nigeria by establishing a Marxist-Leninist state many Nigerians are becoming sympathetic to the cause, especially among labor union circles."
 nga60.14.d:0 "The Nigerian general election is coming up and two main parties are coming to the for front in popularity. The first is the well established big tent party composing Pan-Africanists, Social Democrats, and some more moderate Social-Liberal elements, the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons lead by Nnamdi Azikiwe. Secondly we have the underdog party - the Kemalist Dynamic Party. One of the first parties to have a formal manifesto, it is lead by mathematician-scholar Chike Obi; the party claims to follow a path of westernization and modernization. Their main foreign policy goals are a West African Federation, an African Monroe Doctrine, and an alliance with India against South Africa."
 nga60.15.d:0 "With the Biafran oil rights in mind France is planning to give us some much needed military support in our war against the north. Despite much criticism that this will lead to us losing access to our own, others say this deal is merely symbolic and won't require much follow through on our end."
 nga60.16.d:0 "The god Babalú-Aye or Obaluaye, is the yoruba deity of smallpox and healing of disease. Among those that worship him there is in general a disregard or even opposition to western medication which is holding back the health of those in rural communities. Some practicioners have even prevented local vaccination programs for smallpox believing it will anger their god. In response the NCNC administration is attempting to bring teachers and protestant missionaries to the region to diminish this cult."
 nga60.17.d:0 "Our wise president Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe has brought together the diverse ethnic groups of Nigeria for a common cause, erasing the divisions between the three main people of the country. A fluent speaker of Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa the multicultural articulate leader has been able to address the misgreviances of each group which have been explained as originating from decades of colonial exploitation. The British divide and conquer scheme had greatly scarred the former colony as they attempted to use the authoritarian feudal north to enforce rule over the non-hierarchical south. However in the past few years, Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbos are starting to no longer identify as their ethnic term but rather simply as a Nigerian. Perhaps pan-africanism really has been achieved..."
 nga60.18.d:0 "Through mutual interest and some cunning diplomacy, Chike Obi along with his like minded equivalents in Ghana, Upper Volta, Togo, and Niger have come together to create what is perhaps the biggest step yet taken in pan-africanism. The declaration of the West African federation is now official with the full integration taking place in the following weeks. This however is not entirely a shock to our state systems due to extensive planning which took place in the previous months, which will soften the long road ahead of us for achieving a fully functioning federal state. There are more complicated talks however about our internal plans with aligning other west african nations into our federation."
 nga60.19.d:0 "With the official establishment of the West African Federation its now to time to decide what the capital of the new nation should be as many find Lagos to be too Nigerian Centric"
 nga60.20.d:0 "Pan-Africanism's victory appears right before the world as the Nigerian African Kemalist Chike Obi's extended political talks with Kwame Nkrumah and others have finally resulted in the integration of several West African States into the new loose federation. The plan first proposed in Obi's political manifesto of his Dynamic Party has had a long road reaching this point, which is seen in the many compromises he had to make in the governance and autonomy of the new country. Critics and skeptics outside of Africa however are only asking two things; is it sustainable and will this model expand to other countries?"
 nga60.21.d:0 "As one of the cores of the party manifesto from Chike Obi, our nation has diplomatically established what he calls a "West African Monroe Doctrine" which is an international claim that an attack on any independent African state is an attack on the West African Federation."
 nga60.22.d:0 "Inspired by the American Monroe Doctrine, the West African Federation has made the announcement that any new attempt of colonialism or violation of African sovereignty will be taken as an act of war against the Federation. Tensions with South Africa and Portugal in mind, geopolitical exports watch nervously as to where the rising African power will be asserting its influence."
 nga60.23.d:0 "As part of a Moscow backed coup, Tunji Otegbeye's Socialist Workers and Farmers Party of Nigeria has come to power in Nigeria. Recognized as part of the traditional Old Left, Otegbeye had established himself long before the founding of his party through being a very successful labor organizer and now finds himself taking over the administration of a transitionary government. For the next few years the nation will be under martial law from the Nigerian Liberation army (Newly formed red guard style militias) as authority is asserted throughout the nation. Once national security is achieved Otegbeye has a multi point plan in which he claims through a dialectical understanding of the world Nigerians will no longer experience the issues of the ethnic infighting which has plagued the nation since its early colonial days."
 nga60.24.d:0 "Today Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi announced the beginning of a justified war for the annexation of the English speaking part of Cameroon as he gave a formal declaration of war. The border between Nigeria and Cameroon was originally a part of the single British Cameroon Mandate from end of World War One, with the north going to Nigeria and the south going to Cameroon. However both parts continue to have large English speaking groups and because of this our government believes we can justify to the west our need for national control of the region."
 nga60.25.d:0 "Following a successful campaign against Mali we have been able to reassert control of the nation under Modibo Keïta. With the new alignment to our control, it will now be up our diplomats to negotiate their entry into the West African Federation."
 nga60.26.d:0 "Ever since the 1968 Coup against the Pan-Africanist Modibo Keïta has our foreign policy against Mali been hostile. However with agreements made with the previous leader to restore his regime, the West African Federation is prepared to fight a conventional war against Mali in attempt to bring the nation close towards our Pan-Africanist goal. Officially today Chike Obi has announced a formal declaration of war which has taken a mixed response around the world with France claiming they will back the current Malian regime."
 nga60.28.d:0 "In response to growing tension between C. Odumegwu Ojukwu and [NGA.GetLeader], [GHA.GetLeader] is hosting an internationally observed assembly to come to agreement over the south eastern region's tension. Wanting to avoid a crisis involving the succession of the oil rich region of Biafra, [NGA.GetLeader] is hearing out every request made by C. Odumegwu Ojukwu who has responded openly and positively to the talks made in the friendly and professional setting. C. Odumegwu Ojukwu is seeking the transition of Nigeria into a loose confederation with large amounts of regional autonomy, while [NGA.GetLeader] simply wants the head of state to simultaneously be the head of the armed forces as his end of the deal. In the end however, it seems every proposal made by Ojukwu will be unanimously adopted and military force will not be used in Nigeria under any circumstances."
 nga60.29.d:0 "Regardless of previous conceptions, the agreements of the Aburi Accords have completely fallen apart. As soon as the meetings in Aburi ended there was immediate backtracking on the part of [NGA.GetLeader], with the Igbo states being divided such that the the governorship of Ojukwu would no longer have control of the oil rights in the south east, as the extraction center would be moved into non-Igbo majority states. With anti-Igbo pogroms on the rise and a clear disregard from the national government, Ojukwu has made a call for all Igbos to come back to their ancestoral homeland in the south east. If this didn't make their succession a clear certainty it was a plane crash in Enugu carrying guns from national stockpiles secretly to the region. It will be no doubt, any day now, before the South East declares their independence..."
 nga60.30.d:0 "Despite an attempted negotiation in Aburi Ghana between Biafra's regional governor C. Odumegwu Ojukwu and [NGA.GetLeader], all agreements have been reneged upon leaving disgruntled Ojukwu feeling no option but succession. Ever since the Nigerian Coup of the Five Majors, there have been northerner lead pogroms against the ethnic Igbo who originate from the south eastern region. Biafra, being an oil rich and population dense region of Nigeria feels its people gain no advantage from being a part of national Nigerian government and now president C. Odumegwu Ojukwu believes the nation can sustain itself independently. When asked about fear of an attempt of the Nigerian Armed Forces to resassert control over the region, Ojukwu assured the lack of any organized command structure and battle experience of the nation's young military will be the death of it."
 nga60.31.d:0 "Given the situation, [NGA.GetLeader] has clearly done every politically feasible action he could in following through with the Aburi Accords but in the end, C. Odumegwu Ojukwu's unreasonable nature has resulted in a horrible crisis. To our advantage however is the lack of equipment and funds of the Biafran successionist state, many in our military staff believe the war will be over in a matter of a few weeks. Regardless we should still be cautious despite the weakness of our enemy as we still do not possess a well organized army and will need some time to make a solid military plan. It is time to project internal security and take back control of the south east of our country!"
 nga60.32.d:0 "The Delta State's Delta Volunteer Army has just declared an independent Niger Delta Republic under the leadership of the young Army Major, Police Officer, Teacher, University Student, and Political Activist Isaac Adaka Boro. Boro coming from the Ijaw ethnic group feels that the Delte State being one of the main sources of Oil for Nigeria is profited by only Igbos, Hausas, and Yorubans. As a minority rights activist who saw only constant repressions for his activities he decided to form his own citizen militias to protect his people but now the climax of his activities is achieved with an all out rebellion..."
 nga60.33.d:0 "Ever since Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi put down the coup of the five majors, the common belief among northerners was that the recent events of Nigeria have been taken control of by a conspiracy of Igbos wishing to monopolize the power in the country. Even before the failed Northern Counter-Coup there were plans for the north to succeed. This in mind, many of the northern dominant general staff have been heard mentioning the benefits of an independent muslim dominant hausaland which would no longer be interfered with by Igbos. While this would likely lead to all out civil war, we can not trust that these figures in the military wouldn't consider going to that length with tensions these high."
 nga60.34.d:0 "As some saw coming a major part of the Nigerian general staff have returned to their homeland in the north where they have organized a military insurection lead under general Murtala Mohammed. However many northerners have chosen to stay in our nation whether it be for religious or political reasons and we can expect to hold our own with the sizable military staff that we have maintained. Likely what will become of the Hausaland army is that it will go on a defensive role attempting to draw out our resources in the deserts and mountains of that region of the country. However if we can focus on long term embargos, bombing runs, and artillery strikes, we will surely bring the traitors into submission."
 nga60.35.d:0 "Ethnic conflict in Nigeria has esculated into a tragic crisis. Haile Selassie in his continued quest of being an active participant in positive African foreign policy believes he can negotiate an end to this crisis by finding a mutually beneficial agreement between the Biafran successionists and the Nigerian northerner lead government."
 nga60.36.d:0 "The severe nature of our situation with the Biafran succession has obviously not gone unnoticed by world leaders. Ethiopia's Emperor, Haile Selassie is attempting to host peace negotiations in his neutral nation between C. Odumegwu Ojukwu and [NGA.GetLeader] per usual of his reputation as an inter-African organizer for justice and cordial diplomacy. However clearly the talks are not going anywhere as it seems Ojukwu is not going to settle for anything less than full autonomy and independence of Biafra from Nigeria. With weeks going by and the war being costly, we have to trigger our nuclear option: complete blockade. Surely the Biafrans will not sit and starve themselves when submission is possible."
 nga60.37.d:0 "Despite us trying to make peace with Nigeria in the recent meetings in Ethiopia, they have decided to go all out with their cruelist of options as they can not defeat us militarily. By blockading our ports and preventing any weapons, supply, or food from being imported they believe they can put an end to our brave republic. If we do not turn the tide of the war soon or the international community does not intervene, we may see unimaginable suffering."
 nga60.38.d:0 "Unable to experience anymore major combat success, the Nigerian Federal Army has decided to begin an entire blockade of the Biafran successionist Republic. All across the world to millions of television viewers are tragic, horrid, and traumatic photographs and film of thousands of children and infants starving to death in the south eastern region of Nigeria. This event has created dozens of new NGOs around the world organized around famine prevention, one of the first acts of these groups being the attempt of the world's largest airlift which aims to be more extensive and on a larger scale than even the previous Berlin Airlift. Despite international outrage the United Nations and the major countries of the world have refused to intervene diplomatically in the conflict and Nigeria's Federal Army leadership has stated "Starvation is a legitimate weapon of war, and we have every intention of using it.""
 nga60.39.d:0 "The Nigerian Federal Army since the dawn of the war has been under the assumption that Enugu, the capital of Biafra, being the heart of successionist sentiment, would cause the end of the war when taken. However this preconcieved notion may have been naive as after taking the city resistance continued within it and around the frontlines with Biafra. In a moment of frustration with further progress in the war being haulted in the city, General Murtala Mohammed lead his men in an organized and systematic massacre of over 700 civilians in an attempt to lower enemy morale. Little attempt was made to hide this as the General is hoping news of this event will spread fear throughout the country but others in our government believe this may hurt our international image."
 nga60.40.d:0 "Originally when Murtala Mohammed, Babafemi Ogundipe, Robert Adebayo and others created the Supreme Military Council they intended that their junta would lead the northern region into succession from the Nigerian state but when various government officials and foreign diplomats from the USA and United Kingdom (with their oil rights in the bay of Biafra in mind) convinced them otherwise, the conspirators had to change the pace of their plans. Due to the extreme ethnic tension in Nigeria the junta leaders decided to find the candidate who would be the least controversial, to them this would be Yakubu Gowon. Given a lack of any involvement in politics by the Colonel, along with him not being Hausa, Fulani, or even a Muslim but still a northerner makes him a comfortable choice to be selected as head of state."
 nga60.41.d:0 "Yakubu Gowon has realized that in a situation we have found ourselves in where Nigeria is to be a single federal state, that there will still be a need to check the influence of Western and Eastern Governors. To prevent a situation like the Western Crisis or War in Biafra from taking place again we will be dividing the southern and western regions into subdivisions that will leave resources and population centers in divisions that are not majority Igbo or Yoruba people as the minority ethnicities are far more cooperative and supportive of the federal government."
 nga60.42.d:0 "With the surrender of the Republic of Biafran having been accepted, Yakubu Gowon decided to make a speech on the main rebel radio station of the republic, Radio Biafra. On the network he gave a speech which was characterized by the repeating statement "No Victor, No Vanquished" where he promised a policy of "Reconciliation, Reconstruction, and Rehabilitation" in which he will give amnesty to almost all who fought in the war, give $20 to every citizen of Biafra who had a Nigerian bank account, and begin a repair and development program in the region. Despite these promises, the average citizen of the south east couldn't be any less enthusiastic or optimistic as the claims sound fantasifull to the normal victim of the war."
 nga60.43.d:0 "With the loss of the two major cities of the Republic of Biafra, the president C. Odumegwu Ojukwu fled by plane to the Ivory Coast while Philip Effiong was left to pick up the pieces. In the following hours Effiong agreed to give the formal surrender of the Republic of Biafra to Yakubu Gowon and agree to the full annexation of Biafra. Giving the letter to General Olusegun Obasanjo on the frontlines, fighting would still take several days to end as news did not yet reach the militias fighting in the inner parts of the country."
 nga60.44.d:0 "After the major population centers of Hausaland were taken fighting felt more and more futile for the people of the region. Earlier this week Murtala Mohammed fled across the border into the ethnic Hausa region of Niger where he attempted to rally a base there to no avail. The severity of this situation lead to an attempted coup of Hassan Katsina and then the eventual collapse of an organized government. [NGA.GetLeader] waited as a peace deal from Hassan Katsina arrived agreeing to a full annexation and renouncement of succession which was readily accepted, though fighting would continue in rural regions for several days."
 nga60.45.d:0 "In a counter attack by Biafran commandos earlier an Italian oil complex was taken control of with many low level workers being killed and a group of European expat workers taken hostage. Those in captivity of which included 14 Italians, 3 West Germans and one Lebanese were initially sentenced to death for aiding the Nigerian enemy state through construction of infrustructure. However there has been a massive uproar with the western nations which already were quite hostile to Nigeria, now the United States and United Kingdom are choosing an even more aggressive approach with Baifra following this event. Even the Pope, Paul VI was sending direct mail to Ojukwu which eventually convinced the leader to pardon the prisoners."
