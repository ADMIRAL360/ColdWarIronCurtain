 Tripura.1.t:0 "Tripura Merger Agreement"
 Tripura.1.d:0 "The State of Tripura was one of the ancient princely states of India. According to the Rajmala, Tripura was ruled continuously by as many as 184 Tripuri Kings with sovereign and independent status prior to its merger with the Indian Union in 1949, after the death of the last ruling King, Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman. His successor, Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman, was thirteen years old at the time of the merger. King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman had died in 1947, after which a Council of Regency was formed to run the administration under the presidency of Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, the mother of Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman.\nWithin a few months after the unnatural demise of King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman, Tripura faced a great crisis, with threats from internal as well as external forces. Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, as president of the Council of Regency, came under severe pressure to opt to join the Indian Union. On the advice of the Government of India, she dissolved the Council of Regency and became the sole Regent on 12 January 1948. More than a year later she signed the 'Tripura Merger Agreement', and with effect Tripura became part of Indian Union. It was thereafter administered by the Chief Commissioner as a 'C' Category State."

 india.2.d:0 "India achieved independence from British Raj on 15 August 1947. The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth. India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general.\nOn 29 August 1947, a Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with B. R. Ambedkar as chairman. A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Constituent Assembly. The Assembly met, in sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over a period of two years before adopting the Constitution. After many deliberations and some modifications, the members of the Assembly signed two hand-written copies of the document."

The treaty was signed in New Delhi by the Prime Minister of India Jawahar Lal Nehru and the Prime Minister of Pakistan Liaquat Ali Khan. The treaty was outcome of six days of talks sought to guarantee the rights of minorities in both countries after the Partition of India and to avert another war between us."
 india.52.a:0 "Peace for now"

Naxalbari.1.d:0 "Revolutionary Charu Majumdar has completed a series of documents to guide the ideological principles and revolutionary tactics of militant communist Naxalites. The documents denounce the Soviet Union as revisionist, condemns the Indian state, and calls for a peoples war to overthrow the government. The Naxalites are members of a more radical, splinter group who left the mainstream Indian Communist Party. They felt the ICP was compromised for participating in national politics and engaging with an Indian state Naxalites view as a bourgeois institution. The writings are already spreading across rural areas, especially in Bengal. There are already reports of peasants in the Naxalbari block of the Darjeeling District in Bengal beginning to agitate. The Indian government fears these documents may encourage widespread unrest."
Naxalbari.2.d:0 "Peasant committees, inspired by the writing of Cahru Majumdar recently formed in Darjeeling district and started seizing land from landlords and cultivating It without authority. Some of the effected landlords established armed groups who are targeting sharecroppers suspected of involvement in these committees. Militant peasants are seizing arms, food, and cash from landlords. Over the past few days reports have reached Calcutta that armed peasants are storming local government and police outposts, seizing documents related to land ownership and firearms. Efforts by local authorities to organize police bands failed to dislodge the peasants. The West Bengal government is calling the law and order situation out of control and are requesting the deployment of paramilitary forces to the region."
Naxalbari.3.d:0 "The situation in Darjeeling district continue to deteriorate as efforts at deploying armed police failed to disperse the Naxalite peasant militants. However, the tide started to change once paramilitary forces arrived on the scene. These heavily armed, trained soldiers easily drove off and disarmed a number of militants in the initial phases. The Indian government informed the media the deployment and operations would continue until law and order is restored. A statement by the communist rebels accused the Indian government of atrocities and deploying paid mercenaries to massacre innocent peasants. Overall, the general public appears more interested in restoring law and order than in listening to the demands of the Naxalites."
Naxalbari.4.d:0 "Following the deployment of paramilitary forces, the Naxalite movement appears to have gone underground. Most peasant committees and armed bands have turned in their weapons, while the most radical members appear to have retreated deeper in the jungle or melted into the villages. The Indian government is praising the successful operation and note that several of the more radical communist militants have either been killed or captured during ongoing operations. The Indian public is largely supportive of the government action as many regard the Naxalites as radicals and view their public statements as propaganda. The Prime Minister and military are concerned that once the operations end the rebels may just return so are said to be exploring options to negotiate with the local peasant leaders."
Naxalbari.5.d:0 "Peasant leaders in Darjeeling district announced they would halt armed operations against the Indian state and no longer support the Naxalites. The government claimed once the peasants understood how they were being exploited by the Naxalites, they immediately apologized and pledged to no longer be led astray. The peasant representatives claimed they remained loyal citizens of India and appreciated the effort of the government to restore order and also listen to the grievances of the peasants. The Indian government for its part said it appreciated the support of the peasants and planned on halting paramilitary operations in the region. The government added it would seek to address the concerns of peasants to help restore peace in the region. With this announcement, it appears the government has ended the peasant unrest but there are still concerns over the Naxalite leaders who did manage to escape underground in recent days."
Naxalbari.6.d:0 "The Naxalites have been a thorn on the side of the government for several years. The Prime Minister, taking advantage of the emergency situation, recently directed the Army to coordinate with local law enforcement for an all-out offensive against the group. Once the requisite forces were organized, Operation Steeplechase commenced. Indian troops, including paratroopers, paramilitary units, and police swept through Naxalite-controlled territory. Hundreds of Naxalites were neutralized and at least 20,000 suspected members are in custody. The operation is a resounding success, but the government is keeping details of it secret from the public to prevent public anxiety. The media is being informed not to report on the operation or face prosecution for compromising national security."
Naxalbari.7.d:0 "Charu Majumdar, a founder of the Naxalite movement and leading ideologue for the movement passed away while in custody in in Calcutta. Prison authorities claim he died of a massive heart attack. The police accompanied the body to the crematorium where the family met them. The police prevented the family from viewing the body before overseeing the cremation. The family and critics of the government claim Majumdar was likely killed under torture and are condemning the government for political murder. Majumdar published many notable works but will be remembered for his Eight Documents, which lay the ideological foundation of the Naxalite movement. The Naxalites released a statement promising to continue the struggle and seek justice for their leader."

SINO_INDIAN_WAR.0.d:0 "The border disputes between India and China have escalated in the years since 1947. India has accused China of encroaching on its territory in the North East Frontier Area (NEFA) and stealing Indian land by occupying in Aksai Chin. The Chinese in contrast claim all those territories are historically Chinese. They also accuse India of interfering in Nepal and Sikkim to preserve their own claims and interests. These tensions recently escalated after the Chinese government published a new map confirming its Aksai Chin occupation and claiming all of NEFA as its own. The Indian Prime Minister called an immediate meeting to determine how India will react to this threat. Some are calling for a diplomatic effort, and if that fails, a military deployment. Others are advocating for an immediate military deployment to demonstrate Indian resolve in the face of Chinese provocation."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.1.d:0 "The Indian Army reported that Chinese patrols have crossed the McMahon Line and setup outposts in strategic areas in NEFA. The recent publishing of controversial maps combined with these incursions are causing intelligence officials to conclude China maybe planning to seize NEFA from us. The Indian media is condemning the government and calling for a much tougher line on China. Our forces are monitoring the Chinese and it appears they are holding at the moment. We should decide quickly how to confront the Chinese provocation, whether through diplomatic or military means."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.2.d:0 "The Indian government has issued loud and public denunciation of our recent maps, accusing us of occupying Indian land and claiming their territory. The Indian claims run counter to the historical facts and are based on British imperialist propaganda. We believe the Indians are either trying to save face with their public or are harboring dangerous ambitions against China. We recently received an invitation to hold formal talks regarding the disputed borders with India. Although we are just in our claims, it may prove fruitful to hear out the Indians and understand their ambitions. Senior officials argue we should attend the talks. Others in the government argue we should just decline to show India we will not be bullied."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.3.d:0 "Senior Chinese leaders met with their Indian counterparts to hold talks over their disputed borders. The talks came following a diplomatic escalation caused by the publication of maps by the Chinese government that India claims placed its territory under Chinese rule. In particular the Indian government believes China is encroaching past boundaries negotiated by China and the British Indian colonial government and in the case of Aksai Chin, considered part of Jammu and Kashmir by India, they have simply seized Indian land. China in contrast claims it is occupying historically Chinese territory and India does not have exclusive claims to Aksai Chin due to the disputed nature of Kashmir. Analysts are unsure if India can achieve its goals as China is largely firmly in control of the disputed territories."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.4.d:0 "India has started off our discussions on border disputes by calling for a Chinese withdrawal from Aksai Chin. The Indians claim the territory is historically a part of Jammu and Kashmir and since the Princely ruler acceded the state to India, that land belongs to them. Our own diplomats noted India had no presence in that territory, either in terms of personnel or citizens, and it was our government which established roads to link the area to China. Furthermore, Kashmir is a territory of international dispute and India does not have exclusive claims. We have no intention of giving up Aksai Chin, it is far too important for us strategically and we have invested heavily there. However, we will offer India a deal, they must accept our claim to Aksai Chin, and we will withdraw our own claims to the territory they call the North East Frontier Area."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.5.d:0 "The Chinese government has offered an agreement to end their claims to the North East Frontier Area (NEFA) in exchange for us recognizing their occupation of Aksai Chin. The proposal essentially calls for the current borders to be made permanent and end the dispute. China definitely ends up winning the most though having an established border could reduce the security pressure on India. However, senior advisors warn the agreement will be seen as a defeat for India and we should make a counteroffer. After deliberation it was decided that we will ask China to also confirm its recognition of the borders of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim. Furthermore, China must acknowledge India as the patron power of Sikkim. If China agrees to this, then a deal can certainly be reached. We can also reject this clearly biased solution from the Chinese and recognize they were never serious about negotiations."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.6.d:0 "The Indian government has sent a counteroffer to us. For them to accept our claims to Aksai Chin and make the current border at NEFA permanent, they need us to confirm the current borders of Bhutan, Sikkim, and Nepal. Furthermore, they want us to recognize Sikkim as a part of the Indian sphere of influence. Accepting this would greatly hinder future diplomatic flexibility in the Himalayas but at least our claims would no longer face criticisms from India. If that is important to us, we must accept the agreement. If not, we can end the talks. We already control Aksai Chin and much of our claims to NEFA so a failure to sign an agreement would not be a disaster for our government."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.7.d:0 "Despite widespread skepticism from experts, the leaders of China and India signed a comprehensive agreement to resolve their border dispute. In the final agreement, India must accept Chinese control of Aksai Chin and their current boundary in the disputed NEFA border area. In exchange the Chinese must also accept the current boundary in NEFA and end its claims to the whole territory from India. Furthermore, China has agreed to accept the current borders of Sikkim, Nepal, and Bhutan, using boundaries established by the former British colonial government of India. The agreement appears to be a true compromise. Chinese control of Aksai Chin is legitimized while India has firmly established its influence among the Himalayan states."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.8.d:0 "Hopes that India could negotiate a resolution to their border disputes with China have ended in failure. The Chinese government is being accused by Indian officials and newspapers of harboring hostile territorial designs on India. One particularly scathing editorial noted the Chinese had seized Indian lands since 1947 and when India sought to hold talks to peacefully try and end this aggression, the Chinese proved uncooperative and satisfied with their theft. There are growing calls for the government to take a much stronger approach by deploying troops on the border. In China, the response was largely muted, with senior officials and state media stating that China has no imperialist ambitions and will not be bullied to handing over historically Chinese territory by India. In at least one report a senior Chinese official pointed out that India should be thankful China does not forcibly evict them from the Chinese territory they continue to occupy."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.9.d:0 "Following reports that the Chinese were slowly deploying troops in NEFA, a high-level meeting was called by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister heard from senior defence officials and military leaders about plans to implement the Forward Policy strategy against Chinese infiltrators. Forward Policy calls for Indian troops to establish posts behind Chinese forces to cut them off from their supplies and force their withdrawal. General B.M. Kaul, a leading advocate for the strategy insists Forward Policy is defensive and will result in Chinese withdrawals, with little risk of casualties. He assessed the Chinese military as being largely of militia quality. Some senior generals voiced concerns over escalating the conflict and leaving Indian forces isolated in forward posts, but in the end the Prime Minister approved the plan for implementing Forward Policy in NEFA."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.10.d:0 "The Forward Policy has so far led to success along the McMahon Line. Most of the Chinese incursions have withdrawn back across the line. The Indian Army is ecstatic with the results and they now proposed a plan to establish posts north of the McMahon Line and solidify our claims to the area. Many officers believe the operations prove the hypothesis that Chinese forces lack modern military standards. However, some of the other senior generals are urging caution, stating we have stabilized the borders and should not press an experienced Chinese military. The Prime Minister must decide whether he wants to move forward to finally end the threat of Chinese incursions."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.11.d:0 "The Indian Army has established a series of posts in our territory north of the McMahon Line. The Indians had claimed the McMahon Line marked our border but this incursion clearly shows they have hostile intentions. Our own forces are worried that from these posts the Indians will soon interdict the movement of reinforcements and supplies. However, these posts are largely isolated and if we move adequate forces, they can use infiltration tactics to drive the Indians back. The decision is ours, should we drive off the Indians or let them push us back and make a new defensive line."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.12.d:0 "The Indian government announced its forces had asserted its position in NEFA and had neutralized the Chinese threat to its territory. The Indian Army in its own statement praised the professionalism of its forces in carrying out difficult operations. The Chinese government has not released any public statements, but its diplomats are said to be criticizing India for its hostile action. It appears the Chinese government were not willing to fight for this territory. A Chinese delegation was said to have flown to Delhi for emergency talks."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.13.d:0 "A Chinese delegation arrived in Delhi to hold emergency talks with the Prime Minister over the recent violence along the border in NEFA. The Chinese are asking for us to withdraw to the pre-war McMahon Line border. They promised if we accept, they will ensure their forces no longer carry out incursions and respect the line. They suggested a refusal may cause China to act. The proposal appears reasonable as we have long called for the McMahon Line to be accepted as the border. However, we currently have the advantage and it may be foolish to let it go."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.14.d:0 "The Indian government has shown their imperialistic ambitions by refusing to restore the borders. Despite our call for restoring peace, the Indians instead are now occupying Chinese lands they claimed to have no interest in previously. The PLA is ready for action and is ready to move in if ordered. We must decide if we want to launch an offensive to evict the Indians or if we should just let the situation remain. The people of China are feeling humiliated, perhaps now is the time to act and restore order."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.15.d:0 "The Indian government was stunned to receive news of Chinese troops attacking Indian outposts all along our positions in NEFA. The Chinese government claimed the PLA is moving in to restore order and stability in the area. The Indian Army, although surprised, promises their forces are more than capable to meet the threat. The Chinese government also stated its operations were meant to teach India a lesson on humility. The Indian government in contrast has condemned the Chinese action, calling it a continuation of its hostile actions since independence."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.16.d:0 "The Indians and Chinese are currently embroiled in an armed conflict. Many in the GHQ believe this presents an opportunity for Pakistan to make gains in Kashmir. The conflict has caught our intelligence and military off-guard, many of our forces are currently on leave. However, if we give the order now, we can try to push from Haji Pir and Burzil and seize territory north of Srinagar. This advance will immensely improve our position in Kashmir but not provoke the Indians or international community to the point of overt condemnation. However, if the attack fails we may take unforeseen losses. We must make the decision to deploy the military or not."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.17.d:0 "The Indian military reported to the Prime Minister that Indian forces had launched a limited offensive in Kashmir. Early intelligence and reconnaissance reports indicate this is not the beginning of a full-on invasion but appears to be an opportunistic attempt to make border gains while we are fighting China. We are already reaching out to the major powers to protest this Pakistani aggression, but it appears they will not likely do much considering its limited scope. Regardless, our forces will respond and punish the Pakistanis for this treachery. However, we must be sure that we do not forget the Chinese threat. The people must rally to the nation."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.18.d:0 "The fighting in Kashmir died down in recent hours. Recent reports indicate a new ceasefire is in place and it appears Pakistan now occupies strategic territory north of Srinagar. Jubilant crowds are said to be gathering in major cities across Pakistan following an announcement by the government that some Kashmiri lands had been liberated. The Indian government has tried to remain quiet so far, however, it is clear from private statements that a setback had occurred in Kashmir. Analysts note Pakistan likely improved its position along the border, but it is not likely that they seized huge amounts of lands as that would have provoked a general war and international condemnation. Many Indian newspapers are condemning Pakistan for backstabbing them as they fight the massive communist Chinese invasion."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.19.d:0 "The recent Pakistani offensive against Indian forces in northern Kashmir ended in failure. Pakistan had hoped to take advantage of the Sino-Indian conflict by making gains in Kashmir. Pakistan hoped to establish a new position that would enable it to better liberate Kashmir in the future. Instead, the Pakistani offensive not only failed but saw Indian forces advance and capture the strategic Burzil Pass. With Burzil Pass under Indian control, they are now in a position to threaten Skardu. The Pakistan government conceded an unprovoked Indian offensive had made minor gains but Pakistani forces prevented further losses. Analysts believes the Pakistani military may have rushed into battle hoping to achieve surprise but this ended up backfiring for them. There are reports of angry Pakistani crowds assembling, while the Indian media is full of praise for the armed forces."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.20.d:0 "The Indian government declared its forces had cleared invading Chinese troops and established a new line north of the McMahon Line. India argues it acted only after years of Chinese provocations. The Chinese government was quick to condemn India for its aggression against the Chinese people and claimed their forces had simply been caught off guard and not defeated in combat. The Indian Army is said to be ecstatic with its recent performance in not just repelling the Chinese assault but also pushing them back. While the Chinese government is underplaying the extent of the fighting, privately many analysts believes Beijing will likely conduct an extensive evaluation of its military forces. India must decide if it wants to permanently occupy the land it has gained, risking a general war with China, return the land for security guarantees, or press its advantage and advance deeper into Chinese territory."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.21.d:0 "Following our recent clashes with an aggressive and cunningly prepared Indian military, they occupied lands beyond what they originally claimed. They are calling it the natural frontier of their territory called the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA). Intelligence reports Indian troops are digging in and establishing permanent construction sites. We must decide how to act, either we accept the Indian gains and re-establish a ceasefire line, or we expand the conflict and start a general war to drive the Indians out of these lands." 
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.22.d:0 "The Indian government dispatched a senior diplomat to privately deliver a message. If we would accept the pre-conflict McMahon Line as the permanent border and publicly withdraw our claims to lands south of the so-called McMahon Line. The proposal appeared reasonable and our government accepted, though a further demand we withdraw from Aksai Chin was rejected. Over the next few days the Indian Army withdrew its forces as our troops returned to the area. Our commanders are under strict instructions to obey the established pre-conflict line as the Indians made it clear a failure to do so could result in a fresh attack. The Indians are gloating over their success while we must figure out what went wrong."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.23.d:0 "The Prime Minister lauded the people of India and the armed forces for their steadfast bravery in the face of massive Chinese aggression on the border. Painting a dire picture, the Prime Minister noted the Chinese were only miles from reaching the plains of India and ravaging the nation before the Indian military defeated them. The remarks came following reports that India successfully repulsed a Chinese offensive along their disputed border in the North East Frontier Agency. The Chinese government downplayed the recent setbacks, accusing India of being the aggressor and grossly exaggerating the extent of the fighting. The Chinese media is portraying the fighting as a minor skirmish, but analysts believe the truth lies between the two stories being portrayed."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.24.d:0 "The PLA has successfully driven the Indian troops occupying our lands back and have even pushed deep into NEFA. Some reports are calling the Indian defeat disastrous and claim China has basically completely occupied NEFA. These reports are not that far off, our forces will soon control NEFA and are poised to inflict a devastating blow to India proper. However, doing so may provoke an international intervention and our commanders are not sure if we have the logistical capacity to invade such a large nation. We can either press on and open up the conflict, claim NEFA and risk India expanding the conflict, or simply announce a ceasefire and return to what we see as the pre-war borders to maximize the psychological, diplomatic, and military success of our forces."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.25.d:0 "Sikkim has long been a puppet to the Indian government. Its people are controlled by a puppet prince placed there by British imperialists and maintained by the Indian successor state. The territory offers India a ledge to spy on us and its status as a "independent" state makes it a perfect buffer for them. With our conflict in India heating up, it may be in our interests to no longer accept the myth of Sikkim and its artificial borders. The PLA is ready to move in and liberate its people from local tyranny and Indian hegemony. However, the choice on what to do with Sikkim ultimately lies with the Chairman and Politburo."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.26.d:0 "Following our reversals in the recent border conflict with China, we have lost the North East Frontier Agency. The Chinese attacked with overwhelming and lethal power, catching our forces off guard to seize the lands. Intelligence reports indicate the Chinese are currently digging in the territory and are moving materials to establish permanent structures to solidify their claims. The Indian military admits it was it took a hit in the recent conflict, but if called upon it will strike back. We can order the military to escalate the conflict and launch an all-out attack to drive back the invaders, or we can leave the situation as is and let this fighting come to an end."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.27.d:0 "The Chinese government announced a ceasefire and have withdrawn its forces to the pre-conflict border with India along the so-called McMahon Line. This news has stunned the Indian government which had recently begun a desperate call for help to deal with what it termed to be Chinese aggression. The Chinese government insisted its forces acted defensively and as China was not an imperial power, it had no desire to invade or occupy any other nation. Analysts suggest the Chinese actions mark a diplomatic and military victory. By not seizing lands, China undermined the Indian argument that it faced a massive invasion from China. In addition by publicly showing it was their forces who were withdrawing under no threat from India, it highlights the thoroughness of their military successes in the conflict. Already the Indian media is publishing critical articles and sources indicate the Indian government plans on doing a lot of soul searching."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.28.d:0 "The recent conflict between India and China alongside their disputed border in the North East Frontier Agency ended in a Chinese military victory. The Indian military proved incapable of the task and are being seen as poorly equipped and led during the conflict. Many Indians believe this failure to supply and lead highly motivated and trained soldiers is a result of complacency and lingering colonial influences on the institution. For China, the military victory is seen as confirmation that the PLA is capable of not only waging massive wars but also handle localized threats to its borders. Many now suggest the fighting in India offers a blueprint that can be used in other difficult border areas. Chinese leaders are thrilled by the successful coordination of diplomatic, military, and political power to achieve success."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.29.d:0 "The Indian government has sent out a desperate plea, calling for extensive military aid to strengthen the Indian military as it faces the threat of communist China. Intelligence reports warn a communist advance in India could provoke the Indian communists to abandon the government and break Indian unity. They suggest we should provide military aid, especially for mountain warfare units to help bolster their defenses and help them prevent a deep communist penetration. Although it appears natural we should aid India against a communist foe, some in the administration warn the Indian government has historically been cold to the West. In addition, providing such aid would provoke an angry response from Pakistan. We must decide how to act."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.30.d:0 "Emergency equipment of western arms have arrived to aid the Indian Army in its defence against China. Although our government requested a much larger aid package and called for western bombers to target the Chinese, this support will improve our capabilities. The Defence Ministry will oversee the integration of such equipment to our forces and we have sent a message of gratitude to the United States. Pakistan is furious over the decision, but this is no matter, India needs this support to defend itself. Indian communist activists are also condemning this action, but we informed the public our acceptance of such aid does not indicate we have joined the Western camp."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.31.d:0 "With the conflict between India and China escalating into a full-on war, there may be an opportunity for us. We can mobilize our forces and attack India as they are no doubt distracted by this conflict. Many advocate that a strong strike can secure Kashmir and perhaps resolve some of the lingering territorial issues from Partition. There are already some in the country calling for the government to act in this golden opportunity. However, others in the government are urging caution. They fear if we join the war we may become internationally isolated and lose key UN support for Kashmir."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.32.d:0 "The American Ambassador called on the President for a private discussion. The ambassador gave a dire warning that the United States was aware of our plans to join the war against India. He added if such an action was taken the United States would halt all military and economic aid. It would also pressure its allies to cut off its own support, which would essentially cripple our economy and severely weaken the military. The United States cannot tolerate one of its regional allies joining a communist nation in a war of aggression. After giving this warning, the President called an emergency cabinet meeting. After a brief discussion, it was decided that current plans to join the war will be shelved."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.33.d:0 "In a rare act of cooperation, the United States and Soviet Union have both brought intense pressure, either indirectly or directly to China and India. They are pressuring the two sides to quickly end the current fighting and return peace to the region. So far both governments are resisting the superpower pressure. However, there is wider international concern regarding the potential humanitarian or wider geopolitical consequence of the war if it lasts too long. Privately, the leaders of China and India are informing their commanders that they must achieve results as soon as possible."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.34.d:0 "The United Nations announced a ceasefire between China and India has come into effect. The recent conflict escalated following a series of border clashes along the McMahon Line in the eastern Himalayas. This border conflict escalated into a general war, but the international community quickly put heavy pressure for the fighting to end. There was fear regarding the humanitarian costs of having the two largest populations engaged in an all-out war with one another. The coming days will the final results from the conflict."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.35.d:0 "Following a UN ceasefire, it is clear that India has dominated the former McMahon Line. Chinese troops have largely been driven out and the Indian government claims it will maintain control in order to protect the North East Frontier Area from future Chinese aggression. The Chinese government released a brief statement condemning Indian militarism and imperialist ambitions. Beijing had long claimed the territory, including all of NEFA as its own, but following this setback, it must contend with Indian control of the area."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.36.d:0 "India had vehemently condemned the Chinese occupation of Aksai Chin when it discovered China built highways connecting the region to China. India argued the land was historically part of Kashmir and thus under Indian control. China disagreed, claiming the land as historically Chinese and noting that Kashmir was disputed, negating any Indian claims of complete authority. During the cent conflict, the Indian military managed to successfully dislodge Chinese forces and occupy Aksai Chin for the first time in Indian history. With the ceasefire in effect, the Indian government announced it had liberated Kashmiri land and removed one of the foreign occupiers of the former princely state. It added that complete liberation would be a matter of time. This last statement angered Pakistani leaders who issued a protest statement. Observers note with its victory in Aksai Chin, Pakistan is now more diplomatically isolated with regards to Kashmir and China has lost a key connection between its main lands and Xinjiang."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.37.d:0 "In a major setback for China, the victorious Indian government announced the establishment of a new provisional government of Tibet following a UN ceasefire which ended their recent conflict. The new government in Lhasa is to facilitate the return of an independent Tibetan state. The successful advance of Indian forces pushed the Chinese to the point that their presence in Tibet appears increasingly untenable. Many Western states were quick to praise this decision and the Dalai Lama is said to be preparing for his return to Lhasa. The Chinese government is condemning the installing of a puppet regime and privately there is a fear that Tibet may become lost permanently. In Lhasa, there are reports of civilians celebrating as Indian troops look on, providing security for the festive atmosphere."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.38.d:0 "Following the ending of fighting between China and India following a UN brokered ceasefire, the Chinese announced it was in full possession of its rightful claims along its eastern border. The Indian government has remained mute, but privately some officials have admitted the Chinese are in full control of not just the McMahon Line but also all of the North East Frontier Agency. The lack of Indian reaction and the immense international pressure which brought a ceasefire indicates India will likely have to accept the territorial setback."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.39.d:0 "The end of fighting between India and China saw Chinese forces overrun much of Indian Kashmir. The Chinese are being met as liberators by some Kashmiris, with Chinese troops being greeted by homemade Kashmiri, Pakistani, and Chinese flags. This has recently led to embarrassing propaganda photos and incidents of Pakistani officers acting as "observers" visiting Kashmiri leaders. The Chinese government upped the ante by declaring they will soon withdraw from Kashmir but under the condition that India enforces UN resolutions on Kashmir and hold a plebiscite. The alternative is China continuing to occupy Kashmir or, more likely, hand the territory over to Pakistan. The Indian government is expected to soon announce its intention to hold plebiscite, which will trigger a Chinese withdrawal and a new future for Kashmir."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.40.d:0 "During the recent conflict between India and China, the PLA managed to capture Sikkim. The Chinese portrayed the conquest as a liberation from a corrupt, Indian-backed puppet regime. The Indian government called it a naked land grab and called on the people of Sikkim to stay strong during their difficult time. Regardless, the Chinese remain firmly in control of Sikkim and the Chinese are already announcing plans to integrate the former princely state along the lines of what the government did in Tibet. The former royal family of Sikkim has fled to Delhi and are holding press conferences with Indian and global media."


PAK_INDIAN_WAR.1.d:0 "We will soon approach the UN to arrange a ceasefire to end the current war against Pakistan. Our senior officials and military leaders suggest continuing the conflict will not greatly change the current situation on the ground. Our people and military have fought with immense bravery and discipline. The Pakistani aggression has been met by our strongest resistance and we cannot expect more. It is now our duty to bring the conflict to a conclusion and end the fighting."
PAK_INDIAN_WAR.2.d:0 "Our armed forces gave a befitting reply to the recent aggression by Pakistan. The result of their folly is clear for the world to see. However, a never-ending conflict and arms race in South Asia is not the destiny our founders envisioned for the Indian Union. Now that we have the upper hand, it is a moment for us to reach out and offer brotherly ties with Pakistan. This would also allow us to confirm the new political order in South Asia. Internationally, such an approach will be widely appreciated."
PAK_INDIAN_WAR.3.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested talks with our government. The Indians claim they wish to reset relations and end the years of animosity since Partition. It is likely the Indians want to normalize relations and establish stronger trade ties. Some of our advisors feel this may help out our economy which is reeling from the recent war and losses. In addition, this could build support among the liberal elements of society. However, India is likely capitalizing on their recent military success and to engage them may be seen as acknowledging our weak position. It may be better for the morale of our people to reject this initiative and focus on our efforts to rebuild. We must decide how to respond."
PAK_INDIAN_WAR.4.d:0 "During our talks with India, they have proposed a complete normalization of relations along with an agreement to ease immigration restrictions. The agreement would improve relations, especially trade ties. Our own population would likely support the easing of immigration, this would allow the reunion of families and friends long separated by Partition and offer opportunity for some citizens to reclaim lost properties. However, there is some resistance, especially among senior military officers who believe the best approach would be to walk away from the talks and end the talks. This would assert Pakistani defiance. We must decide how to respond."
PAK_INDIAN_WAR.5.d:0 "Our recent effort to normalize relations with Pakistan has ended in success. The Pakistanis agreed to sign a range of agreements which will improve trade, normalize relations, and ease immigration restrictions. News of the agreement is already being positively received domestically and internationally. The world now sees India is a new type of power. Indians and Pakistanis can now become like the brothers and sisters they were meant to be. We are not a militarist power or imperialistic, instead we are a peace-loving nation devoted to continuous peace."
PAK_INDIAN_WAR.6.d:0 "The Indian effort at normalizing ties with Pakistan ended in embarrassing failure. The Pakistanis condemned the Indians for seeking to cement their recent successes and turn Pakistan into an Indian puppet. The Pakistan government released a further statement claiming they will never give up on their desire to liberate the people of Kashmir and prevent India from becoming a hegemonic power in South Asia. The Indian government responded by saying Pakistan was politicizing a genuine effort at peace and they had only revealed their desire for war."
PAK_INDIAN_WAR.7.d:0 "The military setbacks in our recent war with Pakistan has revealed systemic problems. Parliament, shortly after the conflict ended, established a commission to study these military deficiencies and develop solutions. Their conclusions have been submitted to the Prime Minister who must decide on which recommendation to implement. The Prime Minister must thread carefully as too drastic of an action could break the institutional health of the military. The committee ultimately blamed the backwards colonial heritage inherited from the British. This has led to a recruitment policy which excludes large parts of the population. In addition, this has caused a number of senior officers who reached their ranks largely due to their service in the colonial British Indian Army. One solution is to institute reforms in recruiting, which would allow us to more effectively use our immense manpower. The other solution is to sack a number of Army officers and pave the way for more creative, professional officers to rise. We must decide what reform is most important as doing both could prove catastrophic."
PAK_INDIAN_WAR.8.d:0 "After releasing the committee report on recent military failures, the Prime Minister decided to act. He has announced the sacking of a large number of senior officers, especially Brigadiers, Major Generals, Lt Generals, and Generals. This will pave the way for younger officers to rise. The military response has been mute, but privately many officers are said to be fuming. Regardless, the public is largely supportive of the actions, viewing it as a necessary action. This is no doubt an incredibly difficult day for India, but without these actions, India cannot have the rebirth necessary to overcome its recent setbacks."
PAK_INDIAN_WAR.9.d:0 "The Indian government announced a series of reforms meant to widen the base of recruitment and better connect the military to the people of India. The government added it is following recommendations recently made by the parliamentary committee investigating recent military failures. Many Indians strongly support the decision as many felt the military continues to cling onto colonial practices with regards to its recruiting and organization. The new reforms will expand the base of recruitment and establish more training programs to civilian education institutions. The Indian government added these reforms will help the nation maximize its vast population and resources to better ensure the defence and honor of India."
