 Tripura.1.t:0 "Tripura Merger Agreement"
 Tripura.1.d:0 "The State of Tripura was one of the ancient princely states of India. According to the Rajmala, Tripura was ruled continuously by as many as 184 Tripuri Kings with sovereign and independent status prior to its merger with the Indian Union in 1949, after the death of the last ruling King, Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman. His successor, Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman, was thirteen years old at the time of the merger. King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman had died in 1947, after which a Council of Regency was formed to run the administration under the presidency of Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, the mother of Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman.\nWithin a few months after the unnatural demise of King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman, Tripura faced a great crisis, with threats from internal as well as external forces. Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, as president of the Council of Regency, came under severe pressure to opt to join the Indian Union. On the advice of the Government of India, she dissolved the Council of Regency and became the sole Regent on 12 January 1948. More than a year later she signed the 'Tripura Merger Agreement', and with effect Tripura became part of Indian Union. It was thereafter administered by the Chief Commissioner as a 'C' Category State."

 india.52.a:0 "Peace for now"

Naxalbari.1.d:0 "Revolutionary Charu Majumdar has completed a series of documents to guide the ideological principles and revolutionary tactics of militant communist Naxalites. The documents denounce the Soviet Union as revisionist, condemns the Indian state, and calls for a peoples war to overthrow the government. The Naxalites are members of a more radical, splinter group who left the mainstream Indian Communist Party. They felt the ICP was compromised for participating in national politics and engaging with an Indian state Naxalites view as a bourgeois institution. The writings are already spreading across rural areas, especially in Bengal. There are already reports of peasants in the Naxalbari block of the Darjeeling District in Bengal beginning to agitate. The Indian government fears these documents may encourage widespread unrest."
Naxalbari.2.d:0 "Peasant committees, inspired by the writing of Cahru Majumdar recently formed in Darjeeling district and started seizing land from landlords and cultivating It without authority. Some of the effected landlords established armed groups who are targeting sharecroppers suspected of involvement in these committees. Militant peasants are seizing arms, food, and cash from landlords. Over the past few days reports have reached Calcutta that armed peasants are storming local government and police outposts, seizing documents related to land ownership and firearms. Efforts by local authorities to organize police bands failed to dislodge the peasants. The West Bengal government is calling the law and order situation out of control and are requesting the deployment of paramilitary forces to the region."
Naxalbari.3.d:0 "The situation in Darjeeling district continue to deteriorate as efforts at deploying armed police failed to disperse the Naxalite peasant militants. However, the tide started to change once paramilitary forces arrived on the scene. These heavily armed, trained soldiers easily drove off and disarmed a number of militants in the initial phases. The Indian government informed the media the deployment and operations would continue until law and order is restored. A statement by the communist rebels accused the Indian government of atrocities and deploying paid mercenaries to massacre innocent peasants. Overall, the general public appears more interested in restoring law and order than in listening to the demands of the Naxalites."
Naxalbari.4.d:0 "Following the deployment of paramilitary forces, the Naxalite movement appears to have gone underground. Most peasant committees and armed bands have turned in their weapons, while the most radical members appear to have retreated deeper in the jungle or melted into the villages. The Indian government is praising the successful operation and note that several of the more radical communist militants have either been killed or captured during ongoing operations. The Indian public is largely supportive of the government action as many regard the Naxalites as radicals and view their public statements as propaganda. The Prime Minister and military are concerned that once the operations end the rebels may just return so are said to be exploring options to negotiate with the local peasant leaders."
Naxalbari.5.d:0 "Peasant leaders in Darjeeling district announced they would halt armed operations against the Indian state and no longer support the Naxalites. The government claimed once the peasants understood how they were being exploited by the Naxalites, they immediately apologized and pledged to no longer be led astray. The peasant representatives claimed they remained loyal citizens of India and appreciated the effort of the government to restore order and also listen to the grievances of the peasants. The Indian government for its part said it appreciated the support of the peasants and planned on halting paramilitary operations in the region. The government added it would seek to address the concerns of peasants to help restore peace in the region. With this announcement, it appears the government has ended the peasant unrest but there are still concerns over the Naxalite leaders who did manage to escape underground in recent days."
Naxalbari.6.d:0 "The Naxalites have been a thorn on the side of the government for several years. The Prime Minister, taking advantage of the emergency situation, recently directed the Army to coordinate with local law enforcement for an all-out offensive against the group. Once the requisite forces were organized, Operation Steeplechase commenced. Indian troops, including paratroopers, paramilitary units, and police swept through Naxalite-controlled territory. Hundreds of Naxalites were neutralized and at least 20,000 suspected members are in custody. The operation is a resounding success, but the government is keeping details of it secret from the public to prevent public anxiety. The media is being informed not to report on the operation or face prosecution for compromising national security."
Naxalbari.7.d:0 "Charu Majumdar, a founder of the Naxalite movement and leading ideologue for the movement passed away while in custody in in Calcutta. Prison authorities claim he died of a massive heart attack. The police accompanied the body to the crematorium where the family met them. The police prevented the family from viewing the body before overseeing the cremation. The family and critics of the government claim Majumdar was likely killed under torture and are condemning the government for political murder. Majumdar published many notable works but will be remembered for his Eight Documents, which lay the ideological foundation of the Naxalite movement. The Naxalites released a statement promising to continue the struggle and seek justice for their leader."
