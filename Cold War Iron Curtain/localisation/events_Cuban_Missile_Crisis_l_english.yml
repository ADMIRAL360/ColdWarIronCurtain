 cubamc.1.d:0 "The White House directed the Pentagon to begin deploying squadrons of nuclear armed Jupiter missiles to Italy and Turkey. The deployment in Italy will guard against communist aggression from the Soviet bloc. The missiles in Turkey will defend the southern flank of NATO from overwhelming Soviet aggression. The Italians and Turkish governments agreed to the deployment following one on one meetings with American officials. The Jupiter missiles are Medium Range Ballistic Missiles and their deployment is being met with great concern from the Soviet Union. Moscow believes the missiles are a first strike weapon that are being positioned so close to Soviet territory in order to reduce their potential response time in the event of war. For the American government the deployment is meant to shore up its NATO allies who live under constant fear of potential Soviet aggression."
 cubamc.2.d:0 "The deployment of American Jupiter nuclear missiles to Turkey and Italy is a direct threat to the stability and defense of the Soviet people. Senior military leaders and Premier Nikita Khrushchev have developed the outlines of a plan to secretly deploy Soviet missiles in Cuba called Operation Anadyr. This would restore strategic balance and make the Americans think twice about surrounding our nation with such weapons in the future. To lay the groundwork for this we must secure the cooperation of Cuba and its leader President Fidel Castro. The head of our Strategic Missile Force, Marshal Sergey Biryuzov is being dispatched to Havana and ask for Cuban support."
 cubamc.3.d:0 "Marshal Sergey Biryuzov held initial talks with the Cuban leader President Fidel Castro. He outlined the planned secret deployment of our forces on the island and urged his cooperation. Castro appeared at times enthusiastic over the proposal, saying this would punish the Americans for their aggression towards the Cuban people. However, he expressed worry that accepting the deployment of such weapons would make him appear as a Soviet client and hurt the cause of revolution in the Americas. Instead of a missile deployment, Castro offered a counteroffer where the Soviets sign a Defense Alliance with Cuba. This would guarantee Cuban independence from further American aggression and humiliate them for their failure to suppress the Cuban Revolution. We must direct Biryuzov to insist on a missile deployment, or we can accept the counteroffer."
 cubamc.4.d:0 "Our representatives politely declined the Cuban counteroffer, we explained the United States is already aware of the close relationship between our nations. We then reiterated our desire for the deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. Such a result would not just humiliate the Americans but also firmly put them in the position they have put the Cuban people in with their constant threats of invasion. After some consideration, we are pleased to report President Fidel Castro accepted and announced Cuba would warmly welcome the Soviet deployment. With approval received, plans are already being made to load freighters with building equipment, weapons, and personnel so that we can quickly bring the missiles into operation. Our first deployment will likely take a month."
 cubamc.5.d:0 "Our representatives politely declined the Cuban counteroffer, we explained the United States is already aware of the close relationship between our nations. We then reiterated our desire for the deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. Such a result would not just humiliate the Americans but also firmly put them in the position they have put the Cuban people in with their constant threats of invasion. Unfortunately, President Fidel Castro declined again. He insisted the best way forward would be the signing of a Defensive Alliance. He stated his worry that if the secret deployment of sophisticated Soviet weaponry were discovered, the Americans will portray him as a Soviet client. This would be catastrophic for the cause of revolution in the Americas. It is clear the Cubans will not help us in Operation Anadyr. We must decide whether we sign the alliance, which would hurt the standing of the United States in the region, or just tell the Cubans we will think it over and end the talks."
 cubamc.6.d:0 "In Havana today, senior representatives of the Soviet Union signed a Defensive Alliance with the Cuban government led by President Fidel Castro. The treaty guarantees both nations will come to the others defense in case of aggression. The agreement is being portrayed and seen as a direct response to the United States. President Castro in his remarks noted the treaty shows how deeply the Soviet people care for the oppressed peoples of the world as they agreed with full knowledge of the hostile intentions of the Americans. The Soviet government released its own statement saying it will never abandon the people of Cuba and will continue to aid their revolutionary path. In the United States newspapers criticized the White House for losing Cuba to the communist bloc and raised fears that the Cubans may expand its destabilizing efforts across the region. Analysts also claim the treaty directly challenges the cherished Monroe Doctrine which declares the Western Hemisphere as part of the American sphere ofi influence."
 cubamc.7.d:0 "Freighters from the Soviet Union, carrying troops, engineers, leaders, and heavy moving equipment recently landed in Cuba. Moving secretly, they have already begun upgrading Cuban airfields and preparing launch sites for the nuclear missiles to be loaded on to. The personnel chosen for this assignment are among the best and most loyal in the whole Soviet Union. We do not expect the Americans to discover our activities from intelligence sources on the island. The base and missile crews are being guarded by a large Soviet force and the Air Force will also deploy fighter jets to shore up the air defense of the sites."
 cubamc.8.d:0 "The CIA was conducting regular aerial reconnaissance flights over Cuba to determine their intentions and find evidence of Soviet deployments. However, recently these flights were stopped due to the risk of international incidents and the arrival of sophisticated Soviet anti-air weaponry for the Cuban military. A Navy recon flight recently noticed a Soviet freighter that appeared to be carrying crates of Soviet aircraft parts to Cuba. In addition, intelligence reports indicated the deployment of SAM sites in Cuba along the pattern of those setup to defend Soviet nuclear missile sites. With this information, spy plane flights were resumed, under Air Force control. The subsequent photographs were analyzed, and Soviet nuclear missile launch sites were identified. The President was soon informed, and he immediately called a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council to formulate a response. For many in the government, Soviet nuclear deployments in Cuba was akin to placing nuclear weapons on American soil."
 cubamc.9.d:0 "President Kennedy convened the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOM) to go over the photographs of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba and decide on a response. All the members agreed a decision must be made as soon as possible. In the end, President Kennedy had three options. His first, presented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff called for hundreds of targets to be struck in airstrikes immediately, followed by an invasion of Cuba. The President noted such an option would likely see Berlin fall to the Soviets and weaken NATO. The second option, endorsed by most of the members, would be to establish a blockade to prevent the arrival of more offensive weapons to the island. Finally, there was the option to not respond. Some committee members believed the Soviet deployment was too small to upset the balance of power and making it into an issue could cause unnecessary panic embolden the Soviets."

 cubamc.10.d:0 "News from Havana says American planes have bombed sites and infrastructure across the island. They are apparently targeting our construction sites and Cuban defense infrastructure. The American navy is being mobilized and the Cubans expect a land invasion soon. There are already rumors of American paratroopers or special forces already operating on the island. The Cuban President, Fidel Castro urgently requested our help. We must decide on an adequate response. One option is to back Cuba completely and launch a full nuclear retaliation against the United States, which would devastate both our nations. The second option could be to authorize our forces already on Cuba to engage invading forces, this would be a more limited response, but reduces the risk of a nuclear exchange. Our forces combined with the Cubans may turn the tide of battle. Finally, we can cut our losses and inform President Castro he is on his own."
 cubamc.11.d:0 "Forces from the United States and its allies in West Berlin surrendered to the Soviet military. The American commander made the decision in order to prevent the loss of civilian lives and with a recognition that any armed resistance would lead to the annihilation of his own forces for no gain. The Soviet seizing of Berlin is retaliation to the United States invasion of Cuba. The Soviets claimed its actions were justified as they were securing their own sphere of influence as America claimed it was doing in Cuba. American allies in Europe are said to be fuming over the news with many blaming the reckless actions of the United States over Cuba for provoking this latest Soviet action. It is unknown how the United States will respond or when or if the Soviets plan on returning the surrendered forces. Many in Europe fear the situation is escalating into a new world war."
 cubamc.12.d:0 "The Navy informed the White House its blockade was active. To reduce an escalation in violence or provide an excuse for the Soviets to escalate, the State Department was able to get the blockade approved not as an act of war but as a defense measure to protect the Western Hemisphere. This was done by getting approval from the Organization of American States and pledging that the blockade is only meant to prevent the arrival of offensive weapons to the island as per the terms of the 1947 Rio Treaty. In addition, we provided an ultimatum to the Soviet government that our actions will not cease until all offensive Soviet missiles were removed from the island."
 
 cubamc.13.d:0 "\nThe American people were stunned this evening when President John F. Kennedy informed the nation of the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba. In his address Kennedy noted that any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any state in the Western Hemisphere would be seen as a direct attack on the United States by the Soviet Union. The President also informed his plan of setting up what he described as a quarantine of Cuba. He stated any ships found to carry offensive weapons will be turned back, but those that did not would be allowed entry. He added the United States Navy would implement this quarantine from international waters. He emphasized the quarantine was not going to halt the import of necessities of life or nonmilitary goods. American forces across the globe are also being mobilized."
 cubamc.14.d:0 "The Americans discovered the details of Operation Anadyr and know we intend to deploy nuclear missiles in Cuba. Their recent declaration of a blockade and ultimatum to our government to withdraw the missiles show the operation is no longer a secret. We already have freighters bound for Cuba carrying weapons and the American blockade can easily be the first step in a major escalation in conflict. The leadership has decided to issue orders for our forces in Cuba to prepare for an invasion and our ambassador will inform President Castro that the Americans are aware we already have missiles on the island, and he must prepare his own forces."
 cubamc.15.d:0 "It is clear the American navy intends to board and inspect all our ships as they have already boarded and inspected a ship from Lebanon. The American navy is already moving its ships in the path of our approaching freighters. The captains of our ships are desperate for orders. We must decide whether we want to have the ships hold position and try to negotiate a deal with the Americans or if we should push forward, challenge the blockade. If we go with the second option, the freighters will be followed closely by our submarines in the area. The tension continues to mount as Soviet forces across the world are going on higher alert."
 cubamc.16.d:0 "After tense messages between Moscow and Washington, the White House received a firm offer from Premier Nikita Khrushchev. The Soviet leader promised to withdraw all nuclear weapons from Cuba on the condition we withdraw our nuclear missiles from Turkey and promise not to invade Cuba. Upon hearing the offer, many in the administration immediately insisted we reject the proposal and demand an unconditional Soviet withdrawal. To them the Soviet offer shows weakness. However, the President and his close advisors appear inclined to accept the deal, a war in Cuba would be costly and the missiles in Turkey were largely obsolete. Essentially the United States would lose nothing and achieve its goals while the Soviets could save face internationally. However, not the President must decide which position he will take, the lives of millions are in the balance."
 cubamc.17.d:0 "News reached Premier Nikita Khrushchev and his top officials that the American government accepted his proposal to resolve the crisis in Cuba. Few in the room could hide their delight and relief that a solution had been reached. The Soviet military is already being directed to withdraw forces from Cuba and call back freighters headed for the island. The Americans agreeing to withdraw their missiles from Turkey is being hailed a strategic victory. More importantly, by achieving a guarantee from the Americans not to invade Cuba, we have secured the Cuban revolution. President Fidel Castro did express some disappointment over the result, but he will soon realize this was the best outcome."
 cubamc.18.d:0 "After a tense two weeks in which the world held its collective breath, the Cuban Missile Crisis came to an end. The United States and Soviet Union were able to secure in agreement that will see the Soviet Union dismantle and remove its nuclear forces from Cuba. In exchange the United States pledged it will respect the sovereignty and rights of Cuba. Many are viewing the agreement as a victory for the United States though there are rumors that the American government may have made other concessions regarding the deployment of its nuclear forces. Regardless, the American people are praising the President for his firm leadership during the crisis. Within the Soviet Union, their appears to be tension among the Politburo as many members felt the crisis should not have reached the stage of brinkmanship."
 cubamc.19.d:0 "We have received word that the American government has rejected our sensible proposals and are demanding the unconditional withdrawal of our nuclear weapons from Cuba. The senior military leadership says we now have only two choices. One is to admit the Cuba project has failed and begin the process of withdrawing our forces, thankfully this would not be a difficult process. However, this would be a devastating diplomatic setback for the state. The other option is to order our freighters to push on and try to get past the blockade. This may put the pressure back on the Americans and they will decide whether they want war or not. The decision is ours, the future of the global revolution is on the line."
 cubamc.20.d:0 "The world is breathing a lot easier now that news reached that the Soviet Union will begin dismantling and withdrawing all its nuclear forces from Cuba. The United States insists no agreement was made and the Soviets have decided to make the right decision. News of the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba are being met with praise from American allies while socialist states are reportedly very angry at the apparent Soviet capitulation to American demands. The Cuban government is said to be despondent over the Soviet withdrawal and Fidel Castro is furious that the Soviets have apparently abandoned the Cuban nation. Crowds emerged in cities across America to celebrate the strong leadership of the President throughout the crisis."
 cubamc.21.d:0 "The Pentagon informed the White House that Soviet freighters, likely carrying offensive weapons are attempting to cross the blockade. Our warships have issued stern warnings, but the vessels are ignoring them. We must make a critical decision, order our ships to open fire and neutralize the Soviet vessels or back off and let them pass. Some cabinet officials point out the Soviet presence and nuclear weapons will hardly have an impact on the strategic balance, and we should stand down rather than risk a cataclysmic exchange. Others, especially the military leaders call for our forces to implement the blockade and demonstrate the serious of our position by firing on the disobeying vessels. A monumental decision must be made."
 cubamc.22.d:0 "When Soviet vessels passed through the naval quarantine of the United States and arrived in Cuba amidst much fanfare, it quickly became apparent the American policy failed. The United States previously warned that any vessels violating their quarantine would risk forcible seizure or fire, but this did not happen. Already the naval forces enforcing the quarantine are returning back to their bases. In a national address, the American President stated he ordered the ships to stand down to preserve international peace and prevent the deaths of countless innocents. He accused the Soviets of playing with the fate of the world. The Soviets in contrast stated the United States had ended its illegal piracy and that the Soviet presence on Cuba was meant to defend the small island nation which had already faced American aggression. Internationally the Soviets are viewed as the victors in the Cuban Missile Crisis and are expected to expand its presence in the region, as the world returns from the brink."
 cubamc.23.d:0 "Reports form our freighters pushing towards Cuba is that American warships are firing on the vessels. The ships have virtually no armaments and the Americans appear to be firing to stop the vessels not destroy them in order to inspect their cargo. However, our submarines escorting the vessels are moving in to engage the American naval ships. The Americans have no regard for the safety of the world, or our men; and we have given the submarines orders to defend the freighters at all costs. Hopefully with the element of surprise our vessels will prevail."
 cubamc.24.d:0 "Reports from Havana indicate that nuclear detonations have occurred off the coast of Cuba. These came after news that warships from the United States Navy were engaged in active combat against Soviet naval vessels, including submarines. A representative at the Pentagon addressed the reports by stating Soviet submarines armed with nuclear torpedoes recklessly launched them at American ships implementing the quarantine as endorsed by the Organization of American States. He did not have information on casualties or losses for either side. In Moscow, the Soviets claimed American naval vessels launched an unprovoked attack on unarmed freighters forcing the Soviet submarines to respond in force. Mass chaos is descending in cities across the world as fears of a full-scale nuclear exchange rise."
 cubamc.25.d:0 "In a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior cabinet members, and top advisors, the President of the United States finds himself in a situation he desperately wished to avoid. The use of nuclear weapons by the Soviet navy against American naval ships cannot be left unanswered. There are some calls for an equivalent nuclear strike on a Soviet naval target, but the senior military leaders insist such an approach would only allow the Soviets more time and opportunity to hit American targets. The President agrees and has given orders for the United States to unleash a full nuclear retaliation to ensure the Soviet Union can no longer threaten the world. He also ordered the country implement nuclear defense protocols and prepare for a devastating loss of life. The mood was somber, but all those present knew there was no alternative left."
 
 cubamc.26.d:0 "Senior military commanders informed the Politburo that the Americans were retaliating with a full-scale nuclear attack. The time for politicking or measured responses has passed. The military commanders noted that despite the imminent destruction awaiting huge swaths of the country, we still possess the means to punish them for their aggression. The Soviet Premier next ordered the Strategic Missile Forces to prepare and launch their own full-scale attack. If the Americans chose to destroy the Soviet nation, they will face similar ruin. There was no joy or discussion when the order was given, just a grim realization that everyone had done their duty, and this was the only outcome."
 cubamc.27.d:0 "The visiting Soviet delegation insisted we accept their plans to deploy strategic missiles on our island. They want to do this secretly and claim this would be a more meaningful action than a public treaty of defense as we suggested. If we agree to the Soviet request, it will strengthen our ties and demonstrate the sincerity of our people. In addition, deploying such weapons systems, even secretly, would likely give us the benefits of a defense treaty but avoid the American scrutiny and interference which would surely follow if a formal treaty were signed. However, if the Americans were to discover these secretly deployed weapons, they would paint us as a Soviet puppet, hurting our revolutionary credentials. We must decide to either accept the secret deployment of strategic missiles or inform the delegation we want a mutual defense treaty."
 cubamc.28.d:0 "Following an intense and extensive aerial bombing campaign meant to neutralize Soviet missile sites and Cuban defenses, the United States announced its forces were now landing in Cuba. The United States seeks to neutralize the Cuban government and ensure its people and land are not used as a launching pad to inflict untold destruction on the American people. The Soviet government is said to be formulating a response while it remains unknown how many casualties they or the Cubans received in the initial bombings. Cuban leader Fidel Castro defiantly announced his forces would resist and called on all Cubans to join the defense of the island from imperialist aggression. The United States believes it had to act following the discovery of secret Soviet nuclear missile sites being built on Cuba, which is less than a hundred miles from American soil."
 cubamc.29.d:0 "With American immaturity rearing its ugly head over the situation in Cuba and them claiming we interfered in their sphere of influence, we decided to return their actions in kind. Allied occupied Berlin is within the heart of the socialist world and thus interferes in our sphere of influence. We recently directed local commanders to occupying and evict the occupying forces from their section of Berlin. Thankfully the enemy commanders realized their situation and they stood down with no violence. We will repatriate them back to NATO territory. The taking of Berlin is being well-received by the people and the NATO allies of the United States are reportedly infuriated that American adventurism led to the fall of Allied occupied Berlin."

CMC_Sino_India_War.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union offered an overture indicating their interest in a compromise to resolve the crisis in Cuba. The current proposal for Cuba calls for the Soviets to remove their offensive missiles from the island while we remove nuclear missiles from Turkey. The Soviet government also noted the Chinese government used the recent crisis between us to attack India and are currently overwhelming Indian defenses. The Soviet Union appear interested in holding further talks with regards to China, once we agree on the compromise. This represents a potential opportunity to drive a wedge in the communist camp. Many cabinet and defense officials note the United States and Soviet Union have a shared interest in limiting Chinese expansionism in Asia and maintaining international order."
CMC_Sino_India_War.2.d:0 "The American President agreed on a compromise to resolve the tensions in Cuba. Our forces will withdraw nuclear weapons from the island in exchange for the American removal of offensive missiles in Turkey. The President also concurred with our concerns over China and will host us for immediate talks on the issue. The Chinese continue to wage a brutal war of aggression on India, seeking to export a flawed vision of socialism with violence. Such a path will only strengthen their belligerence and ideologically split global communism from the newly independent states. We will quietly dispatch a diplomatic team to hold further talks with regards to the Chinese immediately."
CMC_Sino_India_War.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union sent a private message calling for secret negotiations to find a way out of the current crisis. The communist world remains infuriated by our just decision to intervene in Cuba to protect our borders and neutralize Soviet missile sites. Tensions are increasing by the hour, especially after the Soviets seized Berlin. Our leading advisors argue we should accept the offer to negotiate, noting permanent military occupation in Cuba cannot be the best solution for the long-term. They also point out a failure to even hear the Soviets out will only risk further escalation and alienate our concerned European allies. Negotiations to resolve the current global shift appears to be an attractive option. However, top military advisors believe the talks are only a distraction meant to trick the United States into giving up its current advantage."
CMC_Sino_India_War.4.d:0 "The American armed forces continue their brutal occupation of Cuba. The United States claim it was forced to act due to the deployment of our own missile systems on the island. We have a moral obligation to aid the Cuban people and defend socialism from such acts of naked aggression. We responded by liberating Berlin to show the socialist world cannot tolerate imperialist aggression. However, the existing environment is increasingly hostile, and our government recently invited the United States for secret negotiations to calm the atmosphere. The Americans agreed and our top officials are receiving instructions on how to discuss the situation in Cuba and Berlin once the talks begin."
CMC_Sino_India_War.5.d:0 "We recently opened secret talks with the Soviet Union over our justified intervention in Cuba and their gutless seizure of Berlin. From the early talks it appears we have two ways of resolving this conflict. One would be to restore the pre-intervention atmosphere, that would mean a withdrawal of our military forces from Cuba in return for the restoration of Berlin. This option would restore the pre-crisis norm. The other option is for the Soviet Union to accept a non-communist regime in Cuba in exchange for our recognition of Berlin being a part of the GDR. This proposal would turn the recent escalation into a new norm and re-establish a baseline of normalcy. We must consider if a pro-US Cuban regime is worth the symbolic loss of Berlin and anger from our European allies."
CMC_Sino_India_War.6.d:0 "The United States proposed we accept a non-communist regime in Havana in exchange for their recognition of Berlin as part of the GDR. This proposal will essentially transform the current international situation into the new status quo. Gaining Berlin offers a major symbolic victory, greatly strengthening our position in Europe. Cuba had only recently become an ally and some officials believe losing Cuba for Berlin is not a bad trade. However, other senior officials note the loss of Cuba cripples the Soviet presence in the Americas and hurts our standing among Latin American socialist movements. These officials recommend we instead offer to return West Berlin in exchange for the immediate American military withdrawal from Cuba, restoring its socialist regime. A decision must be made to the proposal."
CMC_Sino_India_War.7.d:0 "The Soviet Union agreed to our proposal to recognize and not undermine a non-communist regime in Cuba in exchange for our government recognizing the GDR as the controlling power of Berlin. The agreement will likely immediately reduce tensions and establish a new status quo. Berlin and Cuba are no longer direct flashpoints, however, we will likely face intense criticism from fellow NATO powers for giving up Berlin. In the end, our analysis recognizes a friendly Cuba offers far more to the global struggle against socialism than maintaining a symbolic presence in West Berlin. The Soviets will feel much more secure in Europe but no longer possess an easy route to infect socialism to Latin America. This part of the negotiations has concluded, however, the Soviets wish to discuss the ongoing Indo-Sino conflict with us."
CMC_Sino_India_War.8.d:0 "The Soviet Union countered our offer with a proposal to return West Berlin in exchange for our complete withdrawal from Cuba. Essentially the Soviets would like to re-establish the pre-crisis situation. Our State Department experts believe this is a fair proposal and ensures all parties can be comfortable that neither side gained in the conflict. More importantly, regaining Berlin will restore confidence and support from our key European allies. Senior defense officials are not happy with the proposal. They believe losing Cuba, considering its valuable resources and geographic location is not worth gaining Berlin which is largely of symbolic value. They argue we should reject the proposal and maintain our advantage, despite the risk in raising tensions."
CMC_Sino_India_War.9.d:0 "The United States showed a return to clarity by agreeing to our proposal. The United States will withdraw from Cuba, allowing its government to return. In exchange, we will return West Berlin to the West. This decision returns the world to the pre-crisis state and will go a long way to reduce tensions. However, the Chinese are currently brutally attacking India, this blatant aggression is undermining the rise of socialism in Asia. We will continue our discussions with the Americans to see if they can be brought in to firmly halt an increasingly erratic Chinese state."
CMC_Sino_India_War.10.d:0 "The United States unfortunately revealed their imperialist colors by refusing our compromise proposal. We sought to restore the pre-crisis state and reduce tensions. However, the Americans remain committed to forcibly repressing the Cuban people with military force and a puppet regime. We will remain extra vigilant with regards to Western aggression. The situation in India is deteriorating, with China continuing its excessive aggression towards it. The Indians have desperately called for any aid, and the Chinese remain committed to their erratic policies, greatly hindering the progress of socialism in Asia. We can take the decision to intervene invade China, to restore order and bring China to heel. Some officials however, advocate this may only exacerbate an already tense international atmosphere and we should not intervene to calm tensions. The Politburo must decide on a course of action."
CMC_Sino_India_War.11.d:0 "In a joint statement, the United States and Soviet Union revealed an agreement to resolve the current global crisis. The news came as a relief and surprise to many across the globe who were unaware the two rivals were engaged in private talks to resolve the crisis. The agreement recognizes the new, democratic regime installed in Cuba by the United States. The Western powers in turn will recognize Berlin as under the authority of the German Democratic Republic. Although the United States and Soviets appear satisfied with the new territorial changes, Western European states area already expressing outrage over the abandonment of Berlin. Socialist parties across the newly independent states and especially Latin America are condemning Moscow for abandoning Cuba."
CMC_Sino_India_War.12.d:0 "In a joint statement, the United States and Soviet Union revealed an agreement to resolve the current global crisis. The news came as a relief and surprise to many across the globe who were unaware the two rivals were engaged in private talks to resolve the crisis. The agreement restores the previous status quo. The United States will immediately withdraw its forces from Cuba and allow the previous regime to return. At the same time the Soviet forces in West Berlin will withdraw and restore it to the Western powers. Capitals across the globe are warmly receiving the agreement as a key step to de-escalating the recent spike in tension."
CMC_Sino_India_War.13.d:0 "During the second phase of negotiations with the United States, we pointed out the deteriorating situation in Asia. The Chinese government is maintaining a war of conquest against India, threatening to upset the international balance and shift the balance of power. India has called for both of our states to intervene. The Americans are interested in hearing our ideas on dealing with this threat. One option is to assemble a coalition of allies to militarily force China into submission. Another solution could be a joint nuclear strike on China to cripple their war machine. Finally, we can intervene against China ourselves, to relieve pressure on India, and just let the Americans know ahead of time."
CMC_Sino_India_War.14.d:0 "During our negotiations, the Soviet Union informed us that they plan on invading China in the coming days. The Soviets believe a military intervention is the only way to relieve the beleaguered Indian government. Our own analysts note the Chinese military is currently focused on India leaving them especially vulnerable to a Soviet offensive. The Soviet action is certainly welcomed by our government, it means the two largest communist states are at war with one another and India will be spared communist occupation. However, a few advisors noted a decisive Soviet victory could help them regain control of the socialist camp and firmly bring India into its orbit. But this is a risk we have to take as an Asia dominated by the communist Chinese cannot be tolerated."
CMC_Sino_India_War.15.d:0 "During the recent talks, the Soviet Union called for a joint nuclear strike against the communist Chinese military. The Soviet representatives noted the Chinese were increasingly erratic and their war with India threatened to destabilize the entire structure in Asia. One diplomat claimed if their advance in India continues unchecked, all neighboring states would suddenly be at risk. Our own experts note a Chinese victory would give them wider legitimacy within the socialist camp and firmly establish China as the largest socialist bloc in the world. If we agree to launch such strikes, targeting its military, we believe China may be forced to halt and withdraw, providing India relief. However, other advisors fear such a nuclear strike could setup a dangerous precedent and leave China to be gobbled up by the Soviets. The President must decide."
CMC_Sino_India_War.16.d:0 "The Soviet Union proposed a multinational solution to the current Indo-Sino War. They propose our two states, along with India and the Republic of China come together to fight back and defeat the brutal Chinese invasion. They also noted Pakistan could be invited to join on the condition India agrees to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir. We concurred that with a guarantee on Kashmir, Pakistan may be very interested in establishing a coalition that truly challenges China across all her borders. It would certainly be a positive result for our government to neuter a major communist threat in Asia while protecting India. However, many advisors fear such a conflict could turn into a protracted land war and fighting with the Soviets would be unpopular with American conservatives. A decision must be made soon."
CMC_Sino_India_War.17.d:0 "The United States stated they could not join or endorse a military coalition to counter the Chinese invasion of India. The American President is no doubt unwilling to ally with our nation and risk losing precious votes. The greater good does not trump capitalistic impulses. This is a setback but the Americans were clear they found the situation with India greatly disturbing. We are now left with two options, we can either just leave the situation alone and hope for a just resolution or intervene. Our commanders are confident the moment is perfect to attack China while it is distracted, allowing us to neutralize a clear ideological rival without the risk of American hostility. However, war is always fraught with risks, and a number of officials argue leaving the situation alone remains the wisest choice. The Politburo will debate and decide which course of action to take."
CMC_Sino_India_War.18.d:0 "The United States accepted our offer to form a coalition to challenge the Chinese and halt their invasion of India. We will formally notify select, strategic states to join our coalition, including India, and then start the conflict. Orders are being sent to our forces on the Chinese border, with commanders instructed to prepare for operations. The United States promises to offer not just military but diplomatic support to back our operations. The erratic foreign adventures and ideological challenges from China will soon be silenced and we will restore order to the progress of socialism in Asia."
CMC_Sino_India_War.19.d:0 "The Indo-Sino War appeared to be turning into a major setback for India. However, the United States and Soviet Union decided to intervene and formed a coalition to organize an effective response. Our nation joined the coalition to check Chinese expansionism and restore peace in Asia. We released statements and directed the media to explain why we are joining the coalition. If China is not halted in India, our own borders will be threatened next. Soviet and American military officials are arriving to meet with our senior commanders to coordinate and determine how we can effectively contribute to the success of the coalition."
CMC_Sino_India_War.20.d:0 "The world answered our calls for help. The United States and Soviet Union agreed to form a coalition against China and invited us to join. We agreed to join the coalition, with other partners including Pakistan. However, Pakistan only joined with a promise from us to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir after the conflict. This is a major concession, however, Pakistan promises to provide a large number of troops and as our neighbors their forces can rapidly move in support. Support the government could not forsake at this dire state. For the first time since the end of colonialism, the military might of South Asia will be united. This, combined with the support of our coalition allies should be more than enough to end the Chinese threat."  
CMC_Sino_India_War.21.d:0 "We recently agreed to join the American and Soviet coalition against China. This is in reaction to the ongoing Indo-Sino War to provide support to the beleaguered Indians. Although we have a pact with India, the Kashmir dispute meant Pakistan could not in good conscious send troops while India remains defiant on the issue. However, the coalition, including India, vowed to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir if Pakistan participated. With this, Pakistan could happily join the coalition and offer its military might in defense of South Asia. Many of our commanders trained or served with their Indian counterparts during the World War. Already plans are being made to coordinate efforts and deploy Pakistanis in support of coalition operations. The synergy of Pakistan and Indian forces will no doubt ensure the Chinese are not just halted but thrown back, then Kashmir can chose its destiny."
CMC_Sino_India_War.22.d:0 "The Soviet representatives, after outlining the extreme threat posed by the Chinese and their military adventure in India, proposed establishing a coalition to end the Chinese threat. India would be a natural ally, as would the Republic of China. Pakistan would likely not be willing or able to participate as long as the Kashmir dispute with India remains. Regardless, the Soviets believe their proposed coalition has the military might and strategic positioning to rapidly overwhelm and neutralize China. We must consider this proposal carefully, certainly defeating communist China is an attractive proposition, but this may be at the cost of empowering the Soviet Union. Supporters for the coalition argue the proposed conflict will draw the two largest communist states into conflict and not moving in support of India will just surrender South Asia to Soviet influence."
CMC_Sino_India_War.23.d:0 "The Americans agreed with our proposal to intervene and halt the Chinese aggression against India. More importantly, they have accepted our proposal to launch a joint nuclear strike on PLA military concentrations. Our top military officials are coordinating with their American counterparts to ensure a successful strike. Once launched, the Chinese will be militarily crippled. Enabling the Indians to drive them back. The erratic Chinese regime will suffer for its continued hostility and efforts to ideologically undermine the socialist world."
CMC_Sino_India_War.24.d:0 "The American government declined to intervene to halt Chinese aggression against India. We had hoped to coordinate a joint nuclear strike to destroy Chinese military concentrations and cripple their military capabilities. The refusal is a setback, however, our top military leaders are confident they can successfully intervene against China. We can certainly continue with our preparations to invade the distracted Chinese regime. However, there are those in the Politburo who have reservations, they fear such a conflict could create a schism among the socialist states and lead to a protracted conflict. A decision must be made."
CMC_Sino_India_War.25.d:0 "In a shocking development, the Soviet Union and United States jointly announced they had successfully launched nuclear weapons targeting the Chinese military. They claim their intervention is meant to halt the unjust Chinese invasion of India. There are reports of massive explosions and tremors reaching as far as New Delhi. This is a dramatic intervention into the conflict and a welcome relief to the beleaguered Indian government. The American and Soviet cooperation is stunning to many capitals and populations, as only weeks ago the two states appeared on the brink of all-out nuclear war. Neither government responded to questions on whether this cooperation will lead to a new alliance between the global superpowers."
CMC_Sino_India_War.26.d:0 "The brave soldiers of the PLA were the victims of a cowardly but devastating nuclear strike by the Soviet Union and United States. Clearly the Soviets have betrayed the socialist cause and are now tools of global capitalism. Our forces and people suffered grievous losses. A joint message from the Soviets and Americans demands we halt our operations against India. They demand our withdrawal from Tibet, East Turkestan, along with ceding disputed territory to India and Pakistan. Specifically, they want India to receive Aksai Chin. Our initial reaction no doubt is to continue the struggle, even if we must return to the countryside, however, there are many in the Politburo who believe we may have to concede now. So we can regather our strength and strike back when the moment inevitably presents itself."
CMC_Sino_India_War.27.d:0 "The United States, during our recent discussion on the brutal Chinese invasion of India, refused to cooperate in anyway to bring the conflict to a swift end. This is a disappointment, but it also is clear the Americans would not oppose if we chose to intervene on our own. Our top military commanders insist we are in a position of strength with the PLA focused on India and believe a swift victory is possible and we can save India. However, there are Politburo members who are concerned any military conflict is rife with risk, and we should not escalate or involve ourselves in the conflict, even with American assurances. A decision must be made."
CMC_Sino_India_War.28.d:0 "The Soviet Union announced it cannot tolerate the current Chinese aggression against India and that is forces are rapidly moving across the border. The Soviets claim they are seeking to swiftly force the Chinese PLA to halt its aggression and cruel domestic policies. The Chinese government claims the Soviet forces are being repulsed and their aggression reveals their true colors as an imperialist state. With both sides claiming early success, it will take some time to determine the true condition on the ground. However, it is clear there is now an all-out war across Asia."
CMC_Sino_India_War.29.d:0 "The United States and Soviet Union announced the formation of a coalition to forcibly turnback the PLA forces invading India. The coalition consists of the two major powers, India, and the Republic of China. The Indian government welcomed the announcement and informed their people that help was on its way. Heavy clashes are expected at the Soviet-Chinese border in the coming hours. The Chinese government showed defiance, vowing to repel the imperialist forces surrounding them and claiming the PLA will not halt in its campaign of revolution."
CMC_Sino_India_War.30.d:0 "The United States and Soviet Union announced the formation of a coalition to forcibly turnback the PLA forces invading India with military action. The coalition consists of the two major powers, India, Pakistan, and the Republic of China. The Indian government welcomed the announcement, informing its people all of South Asia is united to face the Chinese hordes. The coalition also confirmed reports form Pakistan that India has agreed to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir following the crisis. The Chinese government condemned the new coalition as an imperialist grouping motivated by territorial greed. It vowed to repel all invading forces surrounding them and not halt its campaign of revolution."
CMC_Sino_India_War.31.d:0 "Following the US-Soviet joint nuclear strike on PLA formations, the Chinese government refused to cave into what it called naked imperialist demands. As a result, a coalition consisting of the Soviet Union, United States, India, and the Republic of China announced it would begin a military intervention against China. The coalition claims its forces will swiftly halt and drive off the PLA from not just India but all its illegally occupied territories. The Chinese government defiantly noted it would never cave in and would drive off all invaders."

The Chinese government defiantly noted it would never cave in and would drive off all invaders."
CMC_Sino_India_War.33.d:0 "The recent Soviet Union invasion of the illegal regime occupying the mainland presents a unique opportunity. The PLA now faces conflict along its borders with the Soviets and Indians. Our top military officials believe the moment is right to initiate Project National Glory. We can launch our own invasion and begin the liberation of our people. However, there are some in the cabinet who urge caution, they argue the situation is still very fluid and may force us to compromise territorially with the Soviets. They argue the moment may not be right to launch the counterattack that will liberate our people. A decision must be made soon."
CMC_Sino_India_War.34.d:0 "The Republic of China, based in Taiwan, declared the launch of Project National Glory. The government claims this is the long awaited counterattack that will finally free the mainland from communist oppression. KMT aligned forces are being directed to immediately begin the invasion and calls are being made for KMT sympathizers in the mainland to rise up against the PLA. The communist Chinese government immediately declared the PLA will easily repel this invasion and move to immediately liberate the rest of China. Analysts are raising concern that the current fighting in Asia is only continuing to escalate."
CMC_Sino_India_War.35.d:0 "The PLA and the last remnants of their government officially capitulated to coalition forces, after a difficult campaign. India and Pakistan will receive their disputed territory from China. Tibet and East Turkestan will become independent. Mongolia is to receive Inner Mongolia. The Soviet Union will remain in control of Manchuria, claiming its forces are there to maintain order. The rest of the mainland is to be returned to the Republic of China. The United States welcomed the return of democracy to China. India and Pakistan are expected to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir in the coming weeks, with both claiming the action as the first step to a new era of cooperation."

India will receive their disputed territory from China. Tibet and East Turkestan will become independent. Mongolia is to receive Inner Mongolia. The Soviet Union will remain in control of Manchuria, claiming its forces are there to maintain order. The rest of the mainland is in theory still under the control of China, under Lin Biao. However, there are reports of major unrest and anarchy spreading as the government lacks legitimacy and military might."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR_POSTAPOC.1.d:0 "The United States and Soviet Union completed their vicious nuclear exchange over the crisis in Cuba. Both nations are devastated but continuing the struggle. There is no major power capable of challenging the PLA as it continues to punish the Indian Army for its violations. Some in the military believe we achieved our initial goals and we should just call for a ceasefire. We can then prepare for our next moves. However, other officials believe we now possess the opportunity to press on to New Delhi and liberate India for the global revolution."

Pakistan can also be invited to join our war, if we promise them Kashmir."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR_POSTAPOC.3.d:0 "The Chinese government has called for us to intervene and help them finish off India. The PLA is said to be driving deep into India. They are promising the liberation of Kashmir, aside from Chinese claimed territory. This is certainly an intriguing proposal, especially with the other superpowers caught up in their own major conflict. The GHQ believes our forces are eager for conflict and ready to intervene. However, some senior cabinet members fear this may not be the right time. A failed intervention could cripple our forces and end any chance we have to liberate Kashmir in the future."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR_POSTAPOC.4.d:0 "The PLA has completed its liberation of New Delhi and the Indian government has capitulated. PLA and Pakistan soldiers met at their border to celebrate our joint victory. We will hand Kashmir over to Pakistan, while retaining control of Aksai Chin. In addition, we will keep control of the disputed territory we had with India. We will establish a revolutionary Peoples Republic of India in the northeast. The Indian government will lick its wounds and try to rebuild. Its weak structure will make it ripe for a future revolution by Indian peasants. This is a great victory for the revolution."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR_POSTAPOC.5.d:0 "The Indian and Pakistani opposition has fallen decisively to the PLA. This is a major victory for our forces. We will maintain our control of the disputed border territories. East Pakistan will become Bangladesh, under a revolutionary government. A revolutionary government will also be established in northeast India. With our enemies decisively defeated, it will only be a matter of time before the peasants rise up and continue the revolution in Asia."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR_POSTAPOC.6.d:0 "The Indian government announced its forces decisively defeated the PLA. The Chinese government agreed to cede the disputed territories and return Aksai Chin. More significantly, they ended their occupation of Tibet, recognizing its independence. This is a major victory for India. They have not only secured their territories but also established a buffer to the north. The Indian people are celebrating the victory, with Indian soldiers being mobbed in the streets by celebrating citizens."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR_POSTAPOC.7.d:0 "The Pakistan-India coalition successfully thwarted the PLA invasion. The Chinese government has accepted a humiliating defeat. Both nations will receive disputed border lands. More significantly, China agreed to release East Turkistan and Tibet, recognizing them as independent states. This is a major setback for China and there are reports of unrest in major cities. Indians and Pakistanis are said to be celebrating their victory. South Asia now has secured its northern borders, with buffer states separating them from any potential Chinese threat."
Sino_Indian_War_Redux.150.d:0 "The PLA successfully seized the narrow Silgurri Corridor, effectively isolating northeast India from the rest of the country. This offers a unique opportunity as we successfully have checkmated the Indian government. One option is to call a ceasefire, return the territories, this would reduce tensions and open a possibility of reconciliation in the future. The other option is to take the disputed borderlands and establish a Peoples Republic of India under Indian revolutionaries."
Sino_Indian_War_Redux.151.d:0 "The Chinese government announced the establishment of the Peoples Republic of India in the occupied northeast Indian states. The new government will be headed by Charu Majumdar. The new government has called on all revolutionary Indians to come, with the promise of eventually spreading the revolution to India. The Indian government, joined by the United States, condemned what they call a Chinese client state. There are reports of unrest and protests in major Indian cities as many are stunned at the full-extent of the setback."
PRC_Bangladesh_War.1.d:0 "The imperialist client Indian Republic started a war of conquest against Pakistan. They are targeting East Pakistan, seeking to manipulate the situation and empowering the Bengalis. The Pakistanis are desperate for help. Our military leadership believes our forces, with the Peoples Republic of India, we can decisively intervene. The PRI believes they can instigate a revolutionary uprising to support our forces and in the end, India can be brought under a socialist government. However, there are senior officials who believe the Pakistani situation is dire and an intervention could result in a major setback for us, which can reverse all our recent progress."
PRC_Bangladesh_War.2.d:0 "The Peoples Republic of China announced it was intervening in the East Pakistan Crisis with its ally, the Peoples Republic of India. Both governments condemned what they call Indian interference and imperialist ambitions. The United Nations have raised grave concerns over this new escalation and are calling for all sides to halt hostilities. The Pakistani government welcomed the announcement, thanking China for remaining a true all-weather friend. The Indian government has condemned China for seeking to exploit a humanitarian crisis and vowed to continue its effort at swiftly ending the East Pakistan crisis."
PRC_Bangladesh_War.3.d:0 "The Indian government confirmed a large Maoist Naxalite uprising has occurred. They claim the rebels are being armed and directed by the so-called Peoples Republic of India (PRI), a Chinese client state. The Indian government has condemned this direct intervention in its internal affairs and are calling on all Indians to remain united against this massive threat. Foreign reporters are noting the rebels appear to be enjoying a lot of support from certain elements and there are clear signs that the Chinese are funneling equipment to the rebels. The PRI is directly supporting this emerging Indian Civil War."
PRC_Bangladesh_War.4.d:0 "The Peoples Republic of China and its ally, the Peoples Republic of India (PRI) confirmed their victory over the Republic of India. The PRI has assumed control of India, promising to bring a true revolution to the Indian people. The conflict began after the PRI instigated a civil war between the government and its Maoist supporters in India. Surviving Indian government and military officials have fled to neighboring states or the West. The United States and other states have expressed concern over what they see is a major expansion of Chinese influence in Asia."
PRC_Bangladesh_War.5.d:0 "The Indian government confirmed its military had crushed the last remnants of the so-called Peoples Republic of India. This marks the end of the Indian Civil War and the Maoist government established by China. Although the Indian government claims it achieved a total victory, it is believed many hardcore Maoists fled into hiding to prepare for a future guerrilla campaign. Regardless, the Indian government is receiving messages of congratulations and millions of Indians are celebrating the reunification of their nation. The Chinese government remains largely silent to this major reversal."
