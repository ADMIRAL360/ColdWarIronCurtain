Their raid accidentally targeted a house of incidentally catholic individuals. Two civilians have been shot as a result of the raid out of fear that they were IRA men out of uniform. The public outrage has played right into the IRA's hands, and home press accuses the Army of careless slaughter."
 thetroubles.1.d:0 "While North Ireland has had its trouble since time immemorial, it has flared up especially in recent days. The annual Apprentice Boys march in Londonderry, (or Free Derry to the Republicans) has been met with petrol bombs and stones this year from the Irish Catholic community. The police response, expecting an easy dispersal, encountered days of resistance with little relief. The situation has gotten worse as more riots stretch police resources thin. The British Army is being deployed to Ireland to restore order, while the IRA pledges to battle it."

The IRA have contacted us and given us a simple order - evacuate our troops from Ireland and transfer Ulster to the republic or risk more bombs."
 thetroubles.52.d:0 "Today, Headquarters Northern Ireland has issued the order to withdraw all soldiers from Ulster. After a long and bloody guerilla war, the IRA has once again humiliated the British Army, despite their prior defeats in the 40's and 50's. Queen Elizabeth II has assented to a bill that officially transfers the province to the Republic of Ireland, as the island is united under Gaelic rule for the first time in 800 years.
