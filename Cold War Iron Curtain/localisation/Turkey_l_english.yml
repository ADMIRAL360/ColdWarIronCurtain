 POLITICS_ISMET_INONU_DESC:0 "Like Mustafa Kemal before him, the elder statesman in Ankara is revered for having cunningly and diplomatically kept the people of Turkey out of the second world war only until the final year in the conflict, hoping to spare the former Ottoman heartland from the same death and recession that brought the Empire to its knees. Now, with the Axis powers in the west pacified, Inonu stands isolated from his allies in the west, and with the increasing radicalism in Turkey's neighbors in the south, and the looming threat of the new proletarian empire lurking beyond the Black Sea, it falls upon the shoulders of the wise Turkish veteran to tread the narrow path of maintaining the discipline and development of the Turkish State amidst an increasingly volatile Middle East."
