 nga70.1.d:0 "Yakubu Gowon was never the undisputed leader of Nigeria, those in top positions always new he was at the mercy of the initial junta plotters. So it did not come as a suprise when one of the main mastermind of the Northern Counter-Coup, Murtala Muhammad committed a bloodless putsch against Gowon while he was off on a visit representing Nigerian in an Organization of African Unity summit in Kampala. Officially the cause of the coup was a result of Gowon making little progress towards a transition to a civilian government though many believe that Yakubu Gowon was only chosen as the head of state due to being a non-Hausa non-Muslim candidate in a time of ethnic tension. With the Civil War over and Nigeria secured, a Muslim northerner can now can take the charge."
 nga70.2.d:0 "A tragedy occurred today when Murtala Muhammad's car on the way to his office was struck by a series of bullets which killed him immediately. Taking place was an abortive counter-coup to reinstate Yakubu Gowon, lead by Lieutenant Colonel Buka Suka Dimka. While Dimka and his co-conspirators were found quickly and executed by firing squad, the British Government refused to extradite Gowon. With the nation mourning Murtala Muhammad his second in command, Olusegun Obasanjo will now succeed him as head of state."
