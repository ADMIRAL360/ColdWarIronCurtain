 Formosa_Resolution.1.d:0 "The United States Senate passed a joint-resolution called the Formosa Resolution. It states that the President has the authority, at his discretion, to deploy the United States military to secure and protect Formosa (Taiwan) and its surrounding islands in response to any armed attacks by communists. The resolution is being celebrated across Taiwan as its people have long felt the threat of a mainland communist attack. The Taiwanese government pledged to remain steadfast in its defiance of the communists and thanked America for standing with the forces for a democratic China. The Peoples Republic of China condemned the resolution as the first step of America trying to turn Formosa into a colony and imperialist base to attack the revolution. Many Americans support the resolution as demonstrating the commitment of the United States to defend the global community from communism."
Fat_Fucker.1.d:0 "The CIA director, Secretary of State, and top Agency operatives have developed a plan called Project FF, or Project Fat Fucker. The United States recognizes the current political organization in Egypt is unstable and heavily corrupt. If things continue, there is a high risk of a leftist revolution in the country. The plan calls for the CIA to approach King Farouk and put heavy pressure on him to initiate crucial reforms. Ultimately the goal is for the King to reform his government, spread royal authority to efficient ministers, curb corruption and offer a progressive vision for the Egyptian people. If the King refuses to change, then alternatives to his government must be considered, such as the Free Officers, a clandestine movement within armed forces of anti-royal officers interested in establishing a new, nationalist state."
Fat_Fucker.2.d:0 "The United States has approached the King and offered a dire warning. They claim if the current political situation continues, Egypt risks unrest and the overthrow of the monarchy. The Americans are insisting the King implement reforms, curb corruption, and assert his authority over the government. The reforms include giving royal authority to officials and military officers. The Americans essentially want the King to cut ties with some of his close friends, curtail some of his extracurricular interests, and establish a more progressive royal government under the guidance of trained bureaucrats and military officers. The King must decide to accept this pressure and risk his throne to foreign and domestic influence, or stay the course and maintain Egyptian sovereignty."
Fat_Fucker.3.d:0 "The King has acquiesced to American pressure on instituting critical reforms to his government and administration in order to prevent potential unrest or even uprisings. Close advisors to the King are drawing up the relevant orders and bringing in senior civil service and military officers for more prominent roles in the regime. However, although the King has agreed, it remains to be seen how deeply he will remain committed to these reforms. Regardless, the King claims he is acting in the best interests of the Egyptian people and the monarchy. Although the government media is publicizing a new initiative conceived by the King, there are already rumors across Egypt that the King is acting under American pressure. It appears some palace officials, conscious that the reforms will spell their decline, are openly spreading the word."
Fat_Fucker.4.d:0 "Project FF appears to be well on its way to success as King Farouk has indicated a willingness to agree with reforms. However, it is not the first time he has promised reforms but balked to go all the way. Regardless, the CIA and State Department are happy that the King was willing to accept our proposals in principle. The next stage will be to continue pressuring King Farouk until he implements all the reforms and establishes a secure, anti-communist, Egyptian state. Intelligence analysts argue we must continue the pressure on the King. There are fears however, that as word spreads that the King has agreed on reforms, which include giving more power to military officers, anti-royal nationalists in the military, may see this as an opportunity for their own agendas."
Fat_Fucker.5.d:0 "Our efforts to pressure King Farouk into initiating crucial reforms has failed. The King remains steadfast in his own delusions of grandeur and believes our advice is a ploy to establish American dominance in the country. Operation Ff appears to have failed to persuade the King, however, the objective to establish a strong, anti-communist Egyptian regime has not. The CIA has contacts with a group of nationalist, anti-royal military officers called the Free Officers. We can provide this group clandestine support and ensure their protection from counter-coups once they act against King Farouk. The President has directed the State Department and CIA to refocus its efforts on supporting the Free Officers to ensure when King Farouk inevitably falls, he will not be replaced by a leftist, pro-Moscow regime."
Project_FF.1.d:0 "The CIA has initiated an operation to spread information to the international press emphasizing the danger King Farouk of Egypt poses to the middle east. There are an increasing number of reports on Egypt discussing their desire to destroy Israel and rival Arab powers by any means necessary. Congressional allies, among other sources, have "leaked" specially curated intelligence reports suggesting Egypt is preparing to go bankrupt to acquire arms in order to launch attacks against neighboring states. Our agents in Egypt are spreading pamphlets and articles denouncing the corruption and moral bankruptcy of King Farouk in order to undermine his domestic base."
Project_FF.2.d:0 "There is increasing alarm across the United States and Europe over intelligence reports suggesting King Farouk of Egypt is preparing to launch military attacks against Israel and other neighboring states. The reports emphasize the delusional nature of Farouk and suggest he will take Egypt to bankruptcy in order to rapidly acquire arms to achieve his ambitions. Many American officials and their allies abroad note such a scenario is likely and renewed conflict in the region could result in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The Egyptian government denounces the accusations, accusing the West of launching a propaganda campaign against the Arab people."
US_Navy50s.1.d:0 "The United States Navy has held a series of high-level talks among senior officers and national defense leaders to articulate a more modern, proactive doctrine. The United States Navy believes it must deploy fleets across the oceans and position forces that can quickly arrive on the scene of any emerging international crisis. This will enable the United States more international maneuverability as it can quickly establish a forward presence and force projection. To better enact such a strategy, the Navy will required continued and extensive financial support from the government."
CIA_DOM_50s.1.d:0 "The CIA does not have domestic policing powers and is forbidden from spying on Americans at home. However, it does have a National Resources Division with a domestic focus. The NRD oversees several programs for voluntary debriefings of Americans in order to collect public intelligence and the Office of Current Intelligence which gives high-level briefings. However, the agency is rumored to be involved in other operations meant to experiment certain technologies, theories and efforts at influence public opinion. Such operations are critical in strengthening the capabilities of the agency in coming years, but the CIA plans on keeping its operations away from the public to avoid legal challenges."
CIA_DOM_50s.2.d:0 "Near the end of the war, our intelligence agencies discovered advanced and at times terrifying experiments by the Japanese and Germans involving the manipulation and control of the human mind. Many Nazis involved in such programs were arrested by our forces and after the war were employed to continue their studies. Our recent skirmishes with communist forces confirmed they were using their own techniques and experimenting on American prisoners of war. This is unacceptable and we cannot fall behind. As such, the Central Intelligence Agency recently launched Project MKUltra, which will experiment and study the use of specific drugs in order to improve interrogations and explore mind control. The CIA plans to launch tests on military personnel, employees, sex workers, prisoners, and mental patients in order to avoid public scrutiny as some Agency lawyers believe these experiments may violate laws regarding the CIA presence domestically."
CIA_DOM_50s.3.d:0 "Mass media is increasingly becoming a vital medium in how people across the globe consume news. The Soviets are already influencing and manipulating the media to further their political objectives and undermine the United States. To combat this foreign influence and subversion, the CIA recently initiated Operation Mockingbird. CIA agents are recruiting leading American journalists and influential civil groups in order to coordinate an effective response to the Soviet efforts. More importantly, the CIA can help propagate our own media offensives to better persuade the American and international community of our just cause and prevent the infiltration of foreign influence or American communists."
USA_Suez.5.d:0 "The London Stock Exchange has collapsed following news that the United States would begin calling in its war debt from the United Kingdom. This comes after the British government refused demands from Washington to halt its intervention in the Suez. The joint Anglo-French-Israeli invasion, launched after Egypt nationalized the Suez canal, caught the United States off guard. Many American leaders are likening the military action to colonial era gunboat diplomacy which has no role in the modern world and undermines the image of the West across the region. The decision to call in the war debt is leading to widespread panic across Britain, but it may be just the first action. If Britain continues the war, America may soon cut off economic aid, which would be disastrous to a nation still rebuilding from World War II."
USA_KOR_WITHDRAWAL.1.d:0 "The United States has begun withdrawing its forces from Korea. The President announced his decision after a high-level meeting with senior military and defense leaders. The President concluded that the American people had sacrificed and given all it could in supporting the cause of freedom in Korea. However, to stay on would be to sacrifice lives for no reasonable gain and it is time for the people of Korea to standup and fight for their own freedom. The news is being viewed as a fatal setback for the South Koreans and United Nations forces, as the loss of American forces now shift the balance of power noticeably to North Korea. The South Korean government and American allies have harshly criticized the American decision."
Albanian_Subversion.1.d:0 "The British SIS has approached us about a plan to overthrow the communist regime in Albania. The British believe that Enver Hoxha, the communist leader, is still in the process of consolidating his regime and there exists an opportunity to stop the communist expansion. The British believe, with our support, they can parachute highly trained anti-communist Albanian expats to the Mati region of the country. Mati is known for its conservatism and strong ties with the former royal family. The British believe the agents could organize a mass revolt and with supply drops, they can eventually overthrow Hoxha and end the communist threat."
Albanian_Subversion.5.d:0 "The British has helped establish the Free Albania National Committee. The organization consists of anti-communist Albanians living in the west. With this organization, we hope to recruit and organize these Albanian activists for the upcoming operation. The group will send the most promising members to the British for extensive training and preparation for the planned operation. Efforts to attract support for the organization from King Zog have stalled as the former monarch is not willing to compromise on his stance that he is the sole representative of Albanians. The CIA is not willing to be overly involved as they are concerned of the presence of formerly pro-Axis Albanian anti-communist exiles."
Albanian_Subversion.6.d:0 "The British government has approached the CIA for cooperation on its plans for instigating an anti-communist uprising in Albania. The British have established ties with the Free Albania National Committee. Through the organization, the group can provide agents to instigate the operation. However, the British have failed to bring the support of the former Albanian monarch, King Zog. The CIA believes the British have put in a lot of preparation but are concerned over the lack of royal support and presence of former pro-Axis Albanian exiles. Some in the Agency believe it may be a stronger approach to instead go our own way and work with King Zog to orchestrate a royalist uprising."
Albanian_Subversion.7.d:0 "The CIA has declined to cooperate with the proposed Albanian operation. They believe King Zog is the strongest route to provoke an anti-communist uprising. They have expressed skepticism over the feasibility of the SIS plan without backing from King Zog. The British are said to be very disappointed by this result and unsure how to proceed as they needed American bases and airpower for their plan. The CIA hopes the SIS will come around but are confident it will be able to succeed with King Zog."
Albanian_Subversion.8.d:0 "The United States recently launched a diplomatic and media campaign to condemn the Albanian communist regime of Enver Hoxha. The American government is calling for self-determination and accuse the communists of suppressing the rights of all Albanians. The CIA is also supporting the effort by pressing its allies in the international media to publicize reports of communist suppression and statements by anti-communist Albanian exiles. The effort is meant to undermine the communist regime and provide international support for future regime change."
Albanian_Subversion.9.d:0 "The United States announced it would resettle Albanian refugees in the country. The American government stated these refugees are victims of communist aggression and under threat in Europe. The public declaration is meant to expose the human rights situation in communist controlled Albania. For the CIA, the arrival of refugees will allow the organization to strengthen its ties with anti-communist Albanians and identify future operatives and political allies."
Albanian_Subversion.10.d:0 "The Assembly of Captive European Nations has organized in New York City under the supervision of the United States and private guidance from the CIA. The organization brings together anti-communist exiles from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. The organization pledges to liberate their home countries through peaceful means and publicize the reality of life behind the cruel Iron Curtain. Along with the publication of periodicals and newspaper articles, the organization plans on opening branch offices in England, France, and Switzerland. The Soviet Union and its allies will be monitoring the group closely."
Albanian_Subversion.11.d:0 "The Albanian anti-communist revolt, led by Albanian exiles who returned to liberate their country, welcomed the return of King Zog to Tirana. The King had been living in exile since being forced to flee the country following the invasion of Italy in 1939. Although criticized for taking much of the gold reserves of Albania, though he has promised to return it and claimed he had only taken it to protect its theft by foreign powers. The anti-communist uprising drew its largest supporters from regions that remained loyal to the King. While addressing a massive crowd of supporters, King Zog promised to restore Albanian dignity and wealth. Communist neighboring states have condemned the return of King Zog, calling it the beginning of a reactionary nightmare for the people of Albania. The United States and its allies welcome the return of King Zog as a restoration of political freedom to the people of Albania."
US_STEEL.0.d:0 "The price of steel in the United States has seen a dramatic increase. This has raised the concern of President [USA.GetLeader] and his economic advisors. They believe the steel industry, especially dominated by the U.S. Steel corporation, is coordinating its efforts to increase the price of steel to maximize profits. The President believes the price increases will risk an inflationary crisis and could weaken the defense industry if a crisis were to emerge. He is believed to be considering the breakup of U.S. Steel as a way to promote more economic competition and lower prices. However, he would have to consider the potential consequences and legal challenges such an action would cause. U.S. Steel argues the prices are due to the market and increased worker wages. It strongly opposes any attempt at federal interference in its operations."
US_STEEL.5.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] recently directed the government to investigate U.S. Steel for manipulating the market while directing his legal team to begin anti-trust lawsuits to break up the corporation. The President stated that U.S. Steel possessed an unfair monopoly in the steel market and had stifled competition. He proposed the corporation could either go through a series of lawsuits and investigations, or it could simply agree to breakup. After a board meeting, U.S. Steel responded by agreeing to the demands of the President and initiated plans to split the company. The President is facing criticism for what many business leaders call an overreach of executive power, however, many Americans applaud the President for his efforts to protect consumers and promote competition in business."
US_STEEL.6.d:0 "When asked questions about the surge in steel prices, President [USA.GetLeader] stated that while he felt for the American people and industries dependent on steel, this was the price of a free economy. When asked about calls in the press for the President to intervene to force prices down or breakup major steel corporations, the President stated this was not an option. In its own statement, U.S. Steel reiterated that the current price hike was not part of an elaborate scheme but the result of the current market prices and demand."
Decolonization_USA.50.d:0 "A recent speech by the President of the United States has raised eyebrows in capitals across Western Europe. The President condemned European colonialism as a denial to the inalienable rights of colonized people to self-determination and freedom. He noted, continued colonialism only held up archaic systems and radicalized populations against the liberties and progress Democracy offered the world. He called on all European powers with colonies to begin the process of decolonization and help usher in a new global order of free trade, democracy, and cooperation in Africa and Asia."
Korean_War_Yan.1.d:0 "The United States has requested our forces launch an immediate operation to liberate Yunnan from the communists. The United States recently started a war with the communist regime and appear committed to destroying it. The Americans stated their appreciation of our commitment to democracy in China and believe our operations would greatly aid their efforts to defeat the communists. Many of the commanders believe we should act now in the interest of China and to tie down Chinese forces. However, some of the commanders are urging caution, saying we would be operating outside the main American forces and would risk the annihilation of our forces. They believe we should decline the request and enter Yunnan at the time and place of our choosing."
Korean_War_Yan.2.d:0 "The Republic of China forces operating in Burma have agreed to our request for them to launch operations in Yunnan. This is welcome news for our operations. The Chinese will be stretched thin to defend its coast and borders, giving us the option to strike at their weak points. It will also legitimize our mission as liberators of China and champions to its democratic forces. We can expect reports of YANSA offensives in the coming days."
Korean_War_Yan.3.d:0 "The Republic of China forces operating in Burma have declined our request for them to launch operations in Yunnan. This is a major setback for our war efforts. The participation of YANSA forces would have stretched the communists thin and given greater flexibility to our operations. The CIA believes the YANSA commanders were concerned of casualties and perhaps have grown too comfortable in their bases and control of the local drug trade."
Korean_War_Yan.4.d:0 "Reports from China and Burma indicate that the remnants of the Republic of China's Eigth Army has launched an invasion of communist China through the Yunnan province. The Peoples Republic of China promised an immediate retaliation and have downplayed the threat. However, this invasion may end up being disastrous as the communists will now have to commit troops to Yunnan as it engages in a direct war with the United States. The American government welcomed the news, calling it an intervention of a liberation force seeking to end communist tyranny."
Decolonization_USA.2.d:0 "In a recent address, the President called for the decolonization of Africa. The President stated the American people have always supported the cause of liberty and freedom. In pursuance of these values, the end of colonialism and freedom for all Africans is a vital interest to the United States. He ended the address by urging those nations still holding colonies to recognize decolonization is the only just path forward. The address will no doubt cause concern among the colonial powers, but the American government believes it has gained new friends and legitimacy across the African continent. Many anti-colonial organizations have welcomed the news. American businesses and economists are also showing support as ending colonial rule will open new markets for American goods and influence."
Decolonization_USA.3.d:0 "The shift to embrace decolonization, at the risk of alienating powerful allies reflects a return to Wilsonian diplomacy. The American State Department announced the United States firmly supports self-determination for all colonized peoples. This new American effort is meant to strengthen American ties with the newly emerging states and challenge the Soviets as the champion of anti-colonialism in Africa. Privately, the Soviets are said to be concerned over this challenge and there are fears among some Soviet leaders that the Americans may spread this self-determination stance to Soviet influenced areas in Europe and Asia."
Decolonization_USA.4.d:0 "The State Department announced the United States intends to invite newly independent African states to join the Technical Assistance Program. The American government believes the program will provide key technical assistance to aid the transformation of these states into stable, democratic nations. This invitation continues the recent American embrace of decolonization and many see the Technical Assistance Program as a way for America to improve its influence in the continent and curb the threat of communist influence."
Decolonization_USA.1.d:0 "The situation in Africa is rapidly changing. Across the continent, millions are advocating either for greater self-rule or independence from colonial powers. The expansion of education and more radical ideologies in colonies is fueling anti-colonial activism. The State Department believes European powers continuing to hold colonies, even with force, risk radicalizing their colonial subjects and opening the path to communist influence. Some believe the United States must use its leverage over European colonial states to push decolonization, in order to prevent radicalization and open these territories to American cultural and economic influence. However, another group argues such an approach will only facilitate the rise of radical regimes and instead they urge the United States to more openly support colonial states. We can encourage them to implement reforms so they can eventually transfer power to local, pro-Western African elites."
Radio_Free_Europe.1.d:0 "The National Committee for a Free Europe (NCFE) recently launched a new radio station called Radio Free Europe. This new station will conduct broadcasts across Europe and the Iron Curtain to battle communist propaganda. The CIA controls the NCFE and has recruited many prominent anti-communists to support its efforts. Radio Free Europe will broadcast accounts from refugees who have escaped communist regimes. The station is being widely applauded across the United States as a strong response to the rising communist threat."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.2.d:0 "The failed attempt to oust the government of Jacobo Arbenz has resulted in him strengthening his hold over the country. With this stronger support, he will no doubt expand efforts to seize lands and facilities of American interests like United Fruit Company in the country. The CIA believes this will inevitably lead to a transformation of Guatemala into a Soviet client. However, this is not occurring yet. In order to not lose Guatemala and act before the situation is completely untenable, the CIA has a plan to leak certain intelligence in a way to make it appear the Soviets are already making moves to enter the country. Once the American people see Guatemala is on the verge of hosting Soviet forces, we can deploy the military to secure the country."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.1.d:0 "The failure of the CIA to control the situation in Guatemala reflects a wider failure of the Monroe Doctrine. For decades, the Monroe Doctrine has secured our interest and region from hostile ideologies or foreign interference. However, the recent failure highlights the limitations of American influence and now Guatemala is at risk of becoming a Soviet client. Our failure in Guatemala is an open signal to anti-American forces across the hemisphere to begin operations and plans to carry out their own agendas. American allies have also lost faith in our protection and may seek to look elsewhere for support."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.3.d:0 "Reports are spreading across the American and Western press of increasing Soviet influence over the Guatemalan government of Jacobo Arbenz. The reports indicate the Soviets are planning on quickly establishing a relationship with the country and establishing bases in the country. Editorials are already calling for the President to act. The American people are not comfortable with Soviet troops being deployed only miles from the United States. The President is gaining the necessary public backing to take more drastic action to resolve the Guatemalan situation."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.50.d:0 "The leftist regime in Guatemala has solidified its control over the country and instituted draconian measures to curb dissent and setup the further nationalization of foreign companies in the country, especially United Fruit Company, a vital American corporation. The CIA responded with operation PBSuccess, which sought to establish radio broadcasts and instill widespread fear and panic among the Guatemalan people. In this chaotic environment, the Guatemalan military, with its pro-American and anti-communist leadership, would be able to rally even pro-government officers to intervene and end the regime of Jacob Arbenz. However, this plan failed. Once news was leaked of an impending Soviet deployment, the President was able to order the United States military to invade Guatemala to restore democracy and protect American citizens and property in the country, with the support of the American people."
USA_Israel_Lobby.1.d:0 "The situation in the Middle East is precarious. Although the recent Arab-Israeli War has ended in an armistice, both sides appear to be gearing up for a second round of fighting. The Arab World possess valuable resources, especially oil. The Israelis are establishing a democratic state and has a strong affinity towards the West and has the sympathy of the American people. The administration must decide how it will proceed. One group advocates a strong pro-Israel policy including arms deals, this will be well-received by the public and pro-Israeli interests. The Israelis could also help secure our interests in the region. However, doing so would risk Arab ire and access to oil. The other group believes we must maintain neutrality in order to maintain and grow ties with Arab states. From this position we could help broker a future agreement to the long-term benefit of both the Israelis and Arabs."
USA_Israel_Lobby.2.d:0 "The United States, Britain, and France have signed the Tripartite Declaration. The three states pledge to maintain the territorial status quo of as established by the recent Arab-Israeli Armistice agreements. The agreement confirms the commitment of these states to peace and stability in the Middle East and prevent any side from destabilizing the precarious peace. The agreement is being welcomed by the Arab states, desperately rebuilding their military capabilities. The Israelis are said to be upset as they believe their military advantage will soon be lost as the three states also agreed to limit arms sales to the region."
USA_Israel_Lobby.3.d:0 "The United States has refused to sign a proposed Tripartite Declaration proposed by Britain in France. The agreement would call on all three state to preserve the current territorial status quo between Israel and its Arab neighbors. It would also have stipulated the three parties would work to control arms sales to the region. The American government argued the agreement was anti-Israeli as it would deny them access to defense aid while allowing Arab states to more effectively rearm on the global market with its stronger financial position. The American rejection indicates its support for Israel and the Arab states are said to be furious over their position."
Ajax_USA.5.d:0 "The State Department announced the United States strongly opposes the recent nationalization of foreign oil interests in Iran. Such unilateral actions hinder the potential of future investment in Iran and unfairly punish those with interests in these corporations. The United States urges Iran to reconsider its approach and return to the negotiating table to reach a just resolution. The announcement is being welcomed by the British who continue to try and rally international support for its position."
Ajax_USA.6.d:0 "The President of the United States informed the National Security Council that America would not militarily intervene in Iran. The President stated his hope that both Britain and Iran can resolve their disputes peacefully. At this stage, a military escalation would only cause more suffering and greatly weaken the image of the United States abroad. The British government was also informed of this decision and they are expected to be disappointed. If Britain were to launch its own military operations, it would do so at the risk of provoking a negative American reaction."
Ajax_USA.15.d:0 "The President has directed the State Department to criticize British involvement in Iranian affairs. The United States cannot condone such blatant interference as it risks enflaming tensions in the region. It would also weaken Western prestige among post-colonial states. The CIA is being directed to cut off any cooperation with the British over intelligence operations in Iran. If the British insist on its current course, it will have to do so on its own."
Ajax_USA.7.d:0 "The British failure to overthrow the Iranian government has caused it to consider more drastic measures to prevent the nationalization of oil and further erosion of valuable Western interests in the country. The British are now calling on us to support them both militarily and politically in an invasion of Iran. Supporting an invasion and new regime could firmly cement Western control of a key regional state and strengthen British ties. The British also argue the current Iranian government is close to the communist Tudeh Party and if not removed, Iran may be the victim of a Soviet sponsored communist coup. However, such an invasion may have other consequences, such as radicalizing Iranian opposition to us and provoking a wider, regional backlash. The potential reaction of the Soviets must also be considered."
Ajax_USA.8.d:0 "The United States has agreed to our proposal to remove the Iranian government through military action. The current regime in Tehran is clearly under the thrall of the pro-Soviet Tudeh. It is only a matter of time before a Soviet sponsored coup sees Iran become a Soviet satellite. If this were to occur, the Soviets would be in the heart of the middle east. The nationalization efforts and anti-British demonstrations are proof of communist influence. With American support, we can expect a swift victory and diplomatic cover in our operations."
Ajax_USA.9.d:0 "The United States has rejected our proposal to remove the Iranian government through military action. The current regime in Tehran is clearly under the thrall of the pro-Soviet Tudeh. It is only a matter of time before a Soviet sponsored coup sees Iran become a Soviet satellite. If this were to occur, the Soviets would be in the heart of the middle east. The Americans are choosing to ignore the dangerous implications of the recent nationalization efforts and anti-British demonstrations. If necessary, we may need to remove the Iranian threat ourselves, but this will likely result in American diplomatic objections."
Containment_Policy.1.d:0 "The biggest challenge to global order is the rise of radical communist movements across Europe and Asia following 1945. The Soviet Union is blatantly supporting these efforts and are offering arms, training, and cash to these organizations to subvert and overthrow democratic regimes. In territories under Soviet military occupation they have simply purged non-communist political parties and forcibly established communist regimes. To combat this, the United States is establishing alliances among the frontline states facing communists and encouraging collective defense. American military, economic, and political aid will protect these states from overt and covert communist threats. The goal is to surround the communist world and contain it from further expansion."
USA_CWC.1.d:0 "The Chinese Civil War is raging, the Republic of China is struggling to stop the communist Peoples Republic of China. The years of internal conflicts and World War II have sapped much of the Republic of China strength. We must consider our options to approaching the situation. One option is to let things play out, our involvement may only prolong the fighting, bolster the communists, or deplete our own strength. The other option is to approach the United Nations to rally international cooperation in resolving the conflict in favor of the Republic of China. Finally, we can simply intervene directly. We can provide advisors, equipment, and if necessary, a military intervention to save the Chinese people from communist tyranny."
CCW_USA.10.d:0 "In a somber address, the President informed the American people that the United States military would be intervening in the Chinese Civil War. The President said the Republic of China had been a close ally to the United States during the last war, holding the line against the Japanese Empire at tremendous cost. He also noted the close bonds made by the two sides during the war, including the sacrifice of many Chinese lives to protect and host American airmen. He concluded by stating the communists were seeking to exploit an exhausted Chinese nation with its nefarious operations and the people of China needed direct American help to ensure the freedom of its people."
CWC_Police_Action.1.d:0 "The United States has presented a resolution at the United Nations Security Council calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The United States claims the PRC has continuously violated international norms and engaged in gross crimes against its own people. A successful UN vote would give legitimacy for military action against PRC and help establish an international coalition. The only obstacle to the resolution is the Soviet Union, which has veto power on the security council."
CWC_Police_Action.2.d:0 "The United States recently presented a resolution to the United Nations Security Council calling for police against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The United States is trying to build international consensus on its proposed military operations. The PRC is a communist state, however, their leadership at times has been erratic and has shown a desire to eventually challenge our leadership of the communist world. They have at times questioned our revolutionary path. It maybe in our interest to abstain from the vote and allow our two rivals to weaken themselves in armed conflict. However, China is a major communist state and not using our veto could result in a major reversal for communism in Asia."
CWC_Police_Action.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union used its veto power to halt the United States resolution calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). This is a major blow for the Americans who wanted to garner international support for military action. The other communist states are praising our action for defending socialism. The West will no doubt be infuriated but this is nothing new. The PRC also expressed their satisfaction and we can look forward to better relations for the near future."
CWC_Police_Action.4.d:0 "In a surprise move, the Soviet Union elected to abstain from the United Nations Security Council resolution calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). This is a major victory for the United States, which proposed the resolution. Although Soviet allies are not outright condemning the action, many leftist and communist movements have already expressed outrage over the action. The PRC has also condemned the Soviet decision and are openly questioning their revolutionary credentials. The United States will now be able to carry out its military objectives with regards to the PRC."
USA_VIE50s.3.d:0 "The CIA director presented a plan to the President on a way to ensure the ballots are rigged in our favor in the upcoming Reunification Elections in Vietnam. We have established a fairly robust intelligence network in the country. The plan will involve cash, incentives, and some clandestine manipulation of the votes to ensure a democratic victory for the people of Vietnam. However, such an operation may be uncovered and could have drastic consequences in the region. To not act would risk us losing the entire country and potentially the region to a new wave of communism."
Vietnam_RefferendumAH.5.d:0 "The people of Vietnam voted to reject unification. It appears the people of South Vietnam have no interest in being unified and under the control of communist North Vietnam. The results are being welcomed by the American backed South Vietnamese government who argued the North Vietnam government lacked sincerity in holding free elections. The North Vietnamese government has accused the South and its allies of manipulating the results to ensure it did not result in unification and the establishment of a true government that represents the people of Vietnam. They are calling for all the people of Vietnam to express their displeasure and pledged to redouble their efforts in liberating all Vietnamese people."
USA_VIE50s.2.d:0 "The United States has agreed to plans for Reunification Elections in Vietnam that came out of the recently signed Geneva Accords. The agreement came after assurances from the communist north that the election will be overseen by international observers. Our agreement means the South Vietnamese will have to go along with it despite their reservations. The CIA also claims it is unsure how the election will turn out. Regardless, denying the election may only make the southern government unpopular and turn the Vietnamese public overwhelmingly in support of the communists, who claim to represent the nation." 
USA_VIE50s.4.d:0 "Following Reunification Elections, the people of Vietnam have decided to unite under a coalition government of the communist north and non-communist south. The results have seen thousands take to the streets in celebration, many Vietnamese see this as the end of their struggle for peace and independence. The CIA believes the coalition appears stable for now, but warn it may quickly unravel if either side seeks to expand their base. We will monitor the situation closely and work to ensure the communists do not use this as an opportunity to launch a coup and seize power from the freedom loving people of Vietnam."
USA_VIE50s.8.d:0 "The United States will back South Vietnam in its rejection of the Geneva Accords. The South Vietnamese believe the agreement gives the communists a base from which to undermine their government. More importantly, proposals for a Reunification Election are not tenable as the communists will clearly manipulate the vote in its favor, through all means at its disposal. The CIA agrees with this assessment and to ensure South Vietnam is not isolated, we are whole heartedly supporting their stance. The communists will have to make proper compromises and guarantee no subversion for any lasting agreement can be achieved."
American_Aid.5.d:0 "The President directed the Defense Department and State Department to shift aid earmarked for France to Korea and Japan. The United States has determined providing more support to Asia is much more important than focusing so much on Europe. France is a developed and strong nation, it will not be greatly hindered, though the French government will likely not respond well to our decision. The Japanese and Korean government are already expressing their thanks with our increased support. They are crucial frontline states against communism and must be supported."
American_Aid.6.d:0 "The United States announced it would shift aid meant for Britain, Australia, and other commonwealth states to India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The American government recognizes these states are under the risk of Soviet influence and this must be countered. The commonwealth states will be upset by our action, but they will not be overly affected by our actions. The action emphasizes our focus on securing the battle for influence in South Asia and the Pacific."
American_Aid.1.d:0 "The Mutual Security Act was recently passed in Congress. It is a new foreign aid program that will enable the United States to provide aid and grants to friendly states. The support will help those states develop their capabilities and more firmly be able to resist communist influence. Unlike earlier programs, the support will not be limited to any one region or state. It will give the President greater flexibility and strengthen the State Department as it continues to wage diplomatic battles to secure American influence against an increasingly belligerent Soviet foreign policy."
USA_Korean_War.10.d:0 "The United States has declared war on the Peoples Republic of China. The communist Chinese intervention in the war has resulted in massive losses for both sides and heavy fighting between Chinese and American forces. The President addressed congress and described the overt Chinese support for the North Koreans. The deployment of Chinese troops along with heavy weapons and combat aircraft indicates their resolve to wage open warfare on the United States. Not declaring war gives all the flexibility and advantage to China, leaving American troops in Korea vulnerable. But with a declaration of war, the United States can expand its options and hold the communist Chinese regime accountable for its actions. After his comments, Congress voted overwhelmingly to declare war."
CCW_USA.5.d:0 "The United States has called for the international community to step up to provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to the Republic of China. The American representative at the United Nations noted the people of China have faced decades of civil war and warfare, and the communists, instead of joining hands in peace, are instead seeking to exploit this exhaustion for its own gains. Humanitarian aid would provide relief to the Chinese people and the government as it seeks to face the military challenges while also providing basic services to the population. The Peoples Republic of China through their communist allies have condemned the American request, citing it as an attempt to have the international community subsidize the war effort of the Republic of China."
CWC_Police_Action.0.d:0 "As the news from China continues to paint a picture of a beleaguered Republic of China losing ground to the communist Peoples Republic of China, there are increasing reports of a potential American intervention. Topics related to China are said to dominate meetings at the Pentagon, White House, and intelligence agencies. American officers with experience in China during the war are being recalled or redeployed to the Pentagon. In press conferences government officials are constantly expressing concern for the global ramifications of a communist victory in China. These reports are raising concern in Moscow and other communist states that the United States may soon be on the verge of intervening in the Chinese Civil War, risking a dramatic international escalation to the conflict."
American_Ceasefire_Request.1.d:0 "The United States has requested a ceasefire for the conflict in Korea. The arrival of our forces tipped the balance of power against the capitalist Americans and their puppet forces. It is clear they do not see an opportunity to achieve a victory and are not asking for a halt to fighting. Some of our senior advisors advocate this is an opportunity and we should redouble our efforts to achieve total victory. Another group of advisors believe China has demonstrated its commitment to the global revolution and has rendered immense aid in both blood and treasure. They argue we should accept the ceasefire and concentrate on building our socialist state so that we can strike at the Americans when we are at our strongest."
American_Ceasefire_Request.2.d:0 "We recently sent a request for a ceasefire with to the Chinese. They are effectively holding the communist forces together and getting them to agree to a ceasefire would end the fighting. However, the Chinese have foolishly declined the request. It appears they believe victory is at hand for their forces. However, our troops are more than capable of holding them back and punishing them for their mistake. With this Chinese rejection, our commanders are now planning new operations to demonstrate to China that victory is impossible."
American_Ceasefire_Request.3.d:0 "We recently sent a request for a ceasefire with to the Chinese. They are effectively holding the communist forces together and getting them to agree to a ceasefire would end the fighting. Our request has been accepted and plans are underway for a meeting between frontline commanders to ensure a smooth disengagement. The United Nations forces, and American troops have fought bravely against overwhelming odds. The Chinese no doubt also reached the same conclusion that continuing the fighting will achieve nothing and just further sap their forces.
American_Ceasefire_Request.4.d:0 "The bitter fighting in Korea appears to be drawing to a close following news that both sides have agreed to a ceasefire. The war started with the invasion of South Korea by communist North Korea. This provoked the United States to intervene in defense of the South with allied forces under a United Nations mandate. The fighting quickly escalated into a major regional conflict that has recently dissolved into a stalemate with neither side able to achieve a decisive victory. The ceasefire is being welcomed by both sides and the people of both North and South Korea will no doubt be breathing a sigh of relief that the fighting has come to a halt."
PRC_USA_KOR.1.d:0 "Through private channels, the United States has indicated it will soon launch nuclear weapons against our nation unless we withdraw from the Korean conflict. This is a bold threat by either a desperate or bloodthirsty capitalist regime. Some of our senior officials argue the threat is a desperate ploy as our forces have the capitalists and their puppets on the run. To stop now would be foolish and give them the ability to use nuclear blackmail for other conflicts, like the fight for Taipei. However, other officials believe the threat is genuine and fits the American desire for victory at any cost. They argue our initial intervention shows the commitment of China to global revolution and to withdraw now would not leave China vulnerable, it would instead buy time for China to counter the nuclear blackmail. We must either stay and fight, or tactically withdraw."
PRC_USA_KOR.4.d:0 "The Chinese have rebuffed our threats of unleashing our nuclear arsenal against them. China apparently believes we are bluffing and unwilling to bring nuclear weapons into the conflict. The Pentagon is ready to begin preparing the first round of bombs and targets. Using these weapons can turn the tide, reduce our casualties, and perhaps force China into submission. However, some of our senior defense leaders are expressing caution. They fear the consequences of nuclear strikes in Korea, it may provoke a wider conflict or even a Soviet reaction. There are also fears that our decision to bring nuclear weapons into a small regional conflict may set a precedent that allows other states in the future to act similarly. We must decide whether to escalate the conflict, or back down from our threats."
PRC_USA_KOR.2.d:0 "The Chinese government, using private channels, indicated they have heard our warning and will soon begin the withdrawal of Chinese forces from Korea. The Chinese state that this is a tactical withdrawal and warned us to stay away from their border. This is a major victory for us and once the Chinese withdrawal occurs, the balance of power in Korea will shift in our favor. More importantly, this shows the successful ability to tactically use the threat of our nuclear arsenal in order to gain diplomatic and military advantages abroad. Many in the Pentagon are very thrilled that their investment in expanding the nuclear arsenal has paid dividends and likely saved the lives of many American soldiers."
PRC_USA_KOR.3.d:0 "In a surprise announcement, the Peoples Republic of China declared it had achieved its objectives in defending China from capitalist incursions and will begin withdrawing its forces from Korea immediately. The Chinese government added that any further incursions would be swiftly dealt with. The United States and its allies will welcome the news as it shifts the military balance into their favor. Chinese allies are left puzzled as rumors swirl that the Chinese decision may be linked to American threats of introducing its nuclear arsenal to the conflict."
PRC_USA_KOR.10.d:0 "After a bitter conflict, which started with an unprovoked invasion by North Korea, the Republic of Korea has emerged triumphant. With the support of United Nations forces led by the United States, Korea has finally been unified. For the first time since the nineteenth century, Korea is a united, independent state. The Korean government announced it will soon begin a de-communism program and uproot all remnants of the previous regime. The victory was only achieved following the withdrawal of Chinese forces from the conflict, this tipped the balance of power overwhelmingly in favor of the United States and its allies."
USA_VIE50s.10.d:0 "The referendum on the future unification of Vietnam will be held soon. The government must decide whether it will accept the results or reject them. The communists have a powerful propaganda machine and grassroots program. This infiltration of the countryside along with their totalitarian control of the north suggests they could manipulate the polls extensively. However, they have promised to allow the vote to occur freely under international observers. Rejecting the results would alienate our international friends and if we condemn the polls ahead of time and end up getting a positive result, it would be a major blunder. The government must decide if the elections can be trusted."
CWC_Police_Action.5.d:0 "The United States announced its forces had initiated its Police Action against the Peoples Republic of China. The American government continues to insist that the PRC has engaged in an indiscriminate and wanton war of aggression against the Republic of China. The American military action is only meant to halt this aggression and restore peace to the people of China. The communist Chinese government condemned the American intervention, likening it to the gunboat diplomacy of the colonial period and an attempt to colonize China. The Republic of China welcomed the American intervention and criticized the PRC for blatant propaganda."
Ajax_USA.16.d:0 "A combined British and American military force has initiated an invasion of Iran. This is the second British military intervention in Iran since 1939, it comes in response to the Iranian decision to nationalize its oil industry. The United States supports the British claims of its interests being illegally seized. They also support the British stance that the current Iranian government is facing the risk of a communist takeover or is already under covert communist control. Military leaders in Washington and London express confidence of a swift military victory. The Iranian government condemned the intervention and are calling on the international community to support Iran as it faces an imperialist invasion."
KW_EARLY.5.d:0 "The Korean War has come to an end following the announcement that North Korea and the United Nations have agreed to a ceasefire. The conflict began with a surprise invasion of South Korea by North Korea. The communist North Korea government sought to forcibly reunify Korea under its rule. However, the United Nations voted for an intervention led by the United States. After heavy fighting, the conflict had evolved into a bloody stalemate between both sides. With neither party able to gain the upper hand, a ceasefire was signed that will restore the prewar borders. The international community has largely welcomed the end of the fighting."
KW_EARLY.6.d:0 "The treacherous Americans and their puppet allies have refused our just request that all POWs be repatriated to their home country. They insist that every POW will be given the choice to repatriate or remain in the corrupt south. No doubt their extensive propaganda campaign has yielded some successes, which they will use to embarrass us. Many in the Central Committee believe the only response is to continue the war. Once the enemy is sufficiently bled, they will give in to their ridiculous stance. Others however believe the fighting has gone on long enough, and that we should trust the revolutionary vigor of our men. They urge we drop our demand and end the fighting to begin the rebuilding of our nation. In their eyes, those who refuse to return were traitors from the beginning and will be dealt with when we complete the unification of our people."
KW_EARLY.1.d:0 "The South Korean puppet master, the United States, recently initiated ceasefire negotiations with our forces. Our revolutionary spirit and resistance have stalled their nefarious designs. Their immense wealth and advanced weaponry could not overcome our forces. At the moment, they hold tens of thousands of our comrades in prison camps undergoing intensive propaganda. Before any ceasefire can be achieved, we will demand these men be returned home. The Americans insist they will not forcibly repatriate any POWs but talks cannot continue unless they do."
KW_EARLY.2.d:0 "Our talks with North Korea over a ceasefire agreement stalled. The North Koreans are insisting we repatriate all their POWs. This goes against our present position that all POWs should be given the choice to either stay or be sent back. Many POWs express fears of being tortured or even killed if forced back. Others have converted to Christianity and fear religious persecution if returned. Giving into the communist demands would hasten the end of the conflict, however, it would go against all we stand for and alienate the American public. Or we could stick to our stance until the North Koreans drop the demand, they are taking the full brunt of the war and will likely give in in time."
KW_EARLY.3.d:0 "The capitalist stooges agreed to our just demand to return all our POWS. Their scheme of using our comrades for their propaganda purposes and to undermine our revolution has been thwarted. Once our men are returned, we can begin the process of debriefing and reeducation as needed. This removes the final hurdles to our ceasefire talks. Soon, this long struggle will come to an end. We can begin the process of rebuilding our nation and preparing to complete the sacred mission we started."
KW_EARLY.4.d:0 "After difficult talks, the North Koreans have finally agreed to a ceasefire. Our long struggle in Korea has ended. The American people can be proud that its soldiers carried out their duty and our government completed its commitment to the United Nations mission. Despite desperate odds, against an overwhelming communist force, our men held the line. The United States has demonstrated it will stand ready to counter violent communist expansion wherever it occurs. International communism will now think twice before threatening any free nation."
USA_1952_Buildup.1.d:0 "The Democratic Party leaders are growing increasingly concerned by the surging popularity of General Douglas MacArthur, the lead Republican presidential candidate. To counter the popular war hero, General Dwigth D. Eisenhower is being approached to be the Democratic candidate for president. General Eisenhower is perhaps the only officer who can be said to have matched or surpassed the achievements of MacArthur in the war. Eisenhower is also much more popular among the Washington and Pentagon establishment. The Democrats hope its own war hero candidate will be able to defeat the Republican candidate."
USA_1952_Buildup.2.d:0 "General Douglas MacArthur is quickly emerging as the strongest Republican candidate for President. His status as a war hero and natural charisma makes him a very attractive candidate to the voters. For the Republican establishment, MacArthur is viewed with suspicion and a new movement is underway to consolidate establishment support for one candidate to challenge MacArthur. The three options are Governor Thomas Dewey, Governor Harold Stassen, and Governor Earl Warren. All three options are established politicians capable of working within the political system and with the opposition. Republican leaders believe picking of these three candidates to focus establishment support could defeat MacArthur and offer a presidential candidate who can appeal to all Americans."
Decolonization_VIE.1.d:0 "The United States took the unusual step of publicly calling for Free Elections in Vietnam. This comes after the defeat of the communist Viet Minh by the government. The American stance indicates its support for the wishes of the Vietnamese people to be respected, even if the election sees the rise of pro-Communists. This reflects the recent American embrace of decolonization and self-determination. The American government believes its policies will strengthen international support for the United States and ultimately lead to stronger relationships and more stable allies."
AmericanOffer.4.d:0 "The governments of North and South Vietnam agreed to reunify the country following intense negotiations. A new coalition government of unity will be established. The new state pledges it will rebuild what was destroyed in the recent wars and lay the foundation for a strong, independent Vietnam state. In terms of foreign policy the new state pledges it will not intertwine itself with foreign conflicts and risk being a client to any power. Instead, Vietnam will pursue a nonaligned position and be a friend to all. The news is being welcomed as a great diplomatic victory for all the states involved in the negotiations, especially the United States, Soviet Union, and France."
AmericanOffer.1.d:0 "The United States, using backdoor diplomacy have submitted a private offer to our government. They have pledged to withdraw their opposition to reunification on the guarantee we pledge to remain non-aligned in our foreign policy. If we accept the American proposal, the South Vietnamese will have no choice but to accept the elections and we will likely achieve our goal of a unified, independent Vietnam. However, to accept their demand will mean we compromise on foreign policy. The Politburo is divided by the offer. One faction urges an acceptance as this would ensure the rapid unification of the country and the implementation of the revolution across Vietnam. The other faction sees the offer as a sign of American weakness and to sacrifice our foreign policy would compromise any independence. They urge we continue to push for complete independence. The debate must reach a conclusion…"
AmericanOffer.2.d:0 "Our proposal to support reunification in exchange for a nonaligned Vietnam has been accepted by the North Vietnamese. This seems to confirm some of our intelligence which suggests that though communist, they are much more focused on securing and promoting Vietnamese independence and national identity. Although the solution is not necessarily ideal, we have successfully prevented Vietnam from being a bastion of communist and Soviet expansion in the region."
AmericanOffer.3.d:0 "Our proposal to support reunification in exchange for a nonaligned Vietnam has been rejected by the North Vietnamese. Their decision does not surprise many of our intelligence experts who have long viewed the regime a front for international communism. The rejection confirms they are not a nationalist, anti-colonial force as they claim to the public. They ultimately seek to put all Vietnamese under their oppressive control and then use Vietnam as a base to spread communism across the region. We should consider redoubling our support to the South Vietnamese."
USA_INDO.1.d:0 "The American President sent his Secretary of State to deliver a message to our government during a recent visit. The Americans believe the current situation in Indochina is deteriorating and our continued operations will only lead to disaster. They are urging us to consider and begin a diplomatic resolution for the conflict. Although not explicitly stated, it was implied that our refusal to begin talks may result in a reduction of American aid, especially military aid. The senior defense officials believe such a scenario may be catastrophic to our ability to maintain the fight. Perhaps it is time to end this war and dispatch our senior diplomatic and political leaders to begin the process of starting talks."
nato_expansion.1.d:0 "In a recent conference of NATO leaders, discussion was held on expanding the organization to include more frontline states to the organization and strengthen the collective defense of free Europe. West Germany, Greece, and Turkey are all facing communist forces on its borders and the risk of subversion. Leaving these states on their own risks their overthrow and would compromise the position of NATO versus the Soviet Union. These states can be strengthened and protected from overt and covert Soviet threats. However, the proposal to offer membership is being met by resistance, some members are leery of including West Germany so soon after the war. Others fear Greece and Turkey may end up being more of a liability due to their weaker economy and military."
nato_expansion.3.d:0 "NATO has offered us membership to their organization. By joining NATO we would be protected under their mutual defense clause and gain access to advanced military equipment, training, and economic support. However, joining NATO would put us exclusively in the American camp and make us a direct target of the Soviet Union. Some in the cabinet also fear any future conflict would drag Turkey into a wider conflict. The pro-NATO cabinet members believe the organization are essential to securing Turkish independence and further modernizing the nation. They note the without NATO protection, the Soviets will only escalate their efforts to subvert Turkey. Opponents believe joining the organization steers the country away from the Kemalist foreign policy which benefitted the republic for decades and risk dragging Turkey into a devastating war in the future. A decision must be made."
nato_expansion.4.d:0 "Turkey announced its intention to join NATO. The announcement is seen as a major victory for the organization and brings the organization directly to the Soviet border. NATO members are said to be thrilled with the inclusion of a frontline state with a sizeable military and strategic, geographic value. NATO welcomed the decision and promised the organization would protect Turkey and help its people achieve prosperity and cooperation within the organization. The Soviet Union is said to be infuriated and have expressed concerns that the United States will soon establish bases from which to target the Soviet people. The Turkish government hopes membership will bring it access to greater military and economic support."
nato_expansion.5.d:0 "Turkey announced its rejection of the offer for NATO membership. The Turkish government stated joining the organization would undermine decades of foreign policy and risk dragging the Turkish people into a war it has no interest in. The Soviet Union has welcomed the Turkish decision, calling it a responsible, neighborly decision. NATO and the United States in particular will be greatly disappointed for not gaining access to Turkish territory and its sizeable military."
nato_expansion.6.d:0 "NATO recently offered us membership to the organization. Joining NATO would bring us under their collective defense and allow us access to military, economic, and political support. The cabinet will have to debate whether to join or not. Those who believe we should join note we only recently survived an attempted communist takeover influenced by Soviet subversion. Being a part of NATO would give protection and accelerate our recovery from the fighting. The opposition claims Greece cannot rely on other states and by joining NATO it may only encourage more Soviet subversion. They believe Greece has suffered enough in recent years and joining the organization will risk it becoming embroiled in a future European war."
nato_expansion.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Greece announced the government had agreed to join NATO. This makes Greece the newest member of the American-backed alliance. The Greek government noted it looked forward to establishing close bonds with all member states and secure the protection of Greece from any outside threat. The NATO members are thrilled with the announcement, with the Americans interested in potentially establishing bases and facilities to better monitor Soviet actions in the eastern Mediterranean. The Soviets are said to be furious and have lodged a protest to the Greek ambassador in Moscow. Many in Greece are said to welcome the news as it would offer direct protection for a nation that was only recently the target of foreign invaders and then civil war."
nato_expansion.8.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Greece announced the government had rejected an offer to join NATO. The news will be seen as a blow to the organization which hoped to solidify its presence in the eastern Mediterranean and block Soviet influence. The Soviet Union praised the decision as one meant to lower tension in the world. The Greek government stated it rejected joining the group because the Greek people were still recovering and are in no condition to take on the responsibilities of joining a military alliance. Whether this rejection is a sign of Greek neutrality or a shift towards the Soviet camp, only  time will tell."
nato_expansion.9.d:0 "As American, British, and French forces plan to formally end their military occupation of our country, they have offered us membership to join NATO. Joining the organization will finalize our integration into the defense of Western Europe. The Americans in particular believe our membership to NATO is crucial to prevent future Soviet aggression. Joining the organization will aid the remilitarization of our country and allow us to demonstrate that Germany is a power for democracy and freedom in Europe. However, some in the cabinet are urging us to reject the proposal, they note France and Britain are reluctant to see us rearm, which may cause tensions. More importantly, they worry our joining NATO will make reunification virtually impossible as the Soviets will see us as a American client."
nato_expansion.10.d:0 "West Germany formally accepted an invitation to join NATO. This marks a major victory for the organization. News of the announcement was coolly received in London and Paris as many there are suspicious of a rearmed Germany, even as an ally. The United States however, warmly welcomed the news, calling it proof that Germany was rehabilitated and was a willing partner to democracy. For NATO planners, West Germany greatly strengthens the defense of Western Europe both in terms of adding military power but also strategic territory. The Soviet Union is said to be infuriated by the announcement, accusing the United States and NATO of sabotaging any hopes for German reunification and European peace."
nato_expansion.11.d:0 "In a surprise announcement, West Germany rejected NATO membership. This is a major blow for the organization which counted on West Germany becoming a key frontline state for the defense of Western Europe. France and Britain do not appear too publicly disturbed by this direction as many in those countries feared what would happen if NATO rearmed West Germany, even as an ally. The United States is said to be greatly disappointed as it most strongly lobbied for West Germany to join the organization. Many American officials expressed concern the German rejection indicates they may be falling under false Soviet promises of supporting a unified, neutral Germany. The Soviet Union responded positively to the news, praising West Germany for reducing the threat of another European war."
nato_expansion.12.d:0 "As we work to solidify our control of the nation and prevent a communist resurgence, NATO has offered us membership to the organization. Joining NATO would give us access to crucial military, economic, and training support. It would also offer us protection under its collective security clause, protecting us from foreign communist invasion. It may be the shield behind which we build a strong Albania. However, joining the organization may only cause the communists to expand their subversion efforts and raise domestic unrest. NATO would also make us obligated to host foreign troops and join conflicts the Albanian people have no interest in. We must decide if the benefits outweigh the negatives."
nato_expansion.13.d:0 "The Kingdom of Albania indicated it would join NATO as soon as possible. The Albanian government noted its historical ties with member states and its desire to more deeply cement those ties. NATO members are said to be thrilled with the news, many seeing Albania as a key frontline state and a base from which to challenge communist regimes in the Balkans. More importantly, NATO believes it can now protect Albania from direct communist action. The Soviet Union is said to be furious and has long accused the Albanian government of being a American puppet that illegally seized power, noting the Albanian people will not tolerate such oppression for long."
nato_expansion.14.d:0 "The Kingdom of Albania indicated it would not join NATO despite the offer of membership. The organization will be bitterly disappointed as many felt Albanian membership would offer protection to the nation and allow NATO to establish a powerful presence in the Balkans. It appears the Albanians feared joining the organization, would not protect the Kingdom, but instead risk an immediate communist invasion or popular uprising. The new regime is still establishing itself and uprooting the Albanian communist structures. The Albanian government added that though it would not join the organization, it hoped to maintain friendly ties with all NATO member states."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.0.d:0 "The Secretary of State for the United States pledged it will soon bring the recent crisis to the Security Council and General Assembly for discussion. The Americans argue the popular uprising and Soviet intervention indicate the situation may soon escalate into open warfare and even civil war. It is hoped the Security Council could raise awareness to what is occurring in Hungary and condemn the suppression of its people. Many observers believe the American move will be largely symbolic as the Soviet Union controls a veto vote in the Security Council and is unlikely to support anything contrary to its interests."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.1.d:0 "The situation in Hungary is critical. A successful uprising has removed the puppet Soviet communist leadership and the new regime in Budapest indicated its intentions to establish a more independent, and democratic regime. The Soviet Union has responded with an armed intervention, leading to intense street fighting between Hungarian revolutionaries and Soviet tanks. The United States has two options at the United Nations, we can propose a vote to the General Assembly, which will pass, that condemns the Soviet action and call for a full investigation. Which would be a major symbolic victory, or we could propose a United Nations Police Action at the Security Council, though to get it passed we would need to cooperate with the Soviets."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.10.d:0 "The United States has directed its foreign missions and top officials to condemn the Soviet invasion of Hungary. The American government cannot sit idly as Soviet tanks trample the rights and dreams of the Hungarian people. The American action appears to be limited to words at the moment, but its strong, public criticism will raise international awareness on the issue. The Soviet Union and its allies have responded by accusing the United States of hypocrisy, noting its lack of criticism when the rights of citizens in states allied to the United States are trampled on."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.11.d:0 "The United States has proposed a United Nations Police Action to separate the Hungarian revolutionary forces and Soviet troops in Hungary. The American government argues the UN must intervene to ensure the protection and safety of the Hungarian people as well as guarantee their rights are respected. The United States wishes to find a tangible solution to the issue so has directed its top diplomats to approach the Soviet diplomats in order to come up with an acceptable resolution to the matter. Regardless, it will be a tough battle."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.2.d:0 "The United States proposed a resolution in the General Assembly calling for the Soviet Union to halt its intervention in Hungary. The resolution also urges the Secretary General to launch a full investigation into the intervention and determine what happened. The resolution passed with an overwhelming majority as some of the Soviets socialist allies chose to abstain to indicate their own disapproval of what they see as a heavy-handed Soviet response. Although the United States is congratulating itself for its success, many newspapers and Hungarian exiles note the resolution is largely symbolic."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.3.d:0 "The United States has approached us on their plan for introducing a resolution calling for a United Nations police action in Hungary. The American government notes the situation in Hungary is tense and at risk of spiraling out of control. On top of that there is wide international backlash to our actions. They propose that we support the deployment of United Nations forces to ensure a ceasefire and peaceful negotiation can occur to end the conflict. We insisted any UN force must work to disarm Hungarian rebels and must have Soviet observers to ensure their neutrality, the Americans agreed. One faction in Moscow believes supporting the resolution will restore Soviet prestige and negotiations are likely to succeed in keeping Hungary socialist. However, another faction believes we cannot trust the West and are on the verge of victory. We should use our veto power to reject the proposal."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.4.d:0 "The United States presented a resolution calling for the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to Hungary. These forces would separate the hostile powers, disarm civilian militias and other armed groups, while ensuring a peaceful environment for negotiations between the Hungarian parties and Moscow. The Soviet Union was unimpressed, even with offers to be included in the UN mission. The Soviet ambassador lambasted the United States delegation and its hypocritic reaction to events in Hungary. It termed the issue a matter for the Hungarian people and that Soviet forces were keeping the peace already, at the invitation of the government. The Soviet Union went on to veto the resolution, ending any chance of its passing and sending a diplomatic defeat to the United States."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.5.d:0 "The United States presented a resolution calling for the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to Hungary. These forces would separate the hostile powers, disarm civilian militias and other armed groups, while ensuring a peaceful environment for negotiations between the Hungarian parties and Moscow. The Soviet delegation responded positively, noting that its forces were already in the country on the invitation of the Hungarian delegation. It noted UN forces could help support the peacekeeping mission in place and provide greater transparency to the positive role the Soviet Union was playing to resolve the conflict. The Security Council then voted to approve the resolution. The United States views the resolution as a great victory. Analysts also believe, that despite the Soviet acceptance, the resolution represents a recognition by the Soviets that the situation was not being easily resolved through brute military force and it needed to change tact."
USA_FRAIND.1.d:0 "The United States has called for our forces to withdraw from Indochina. They are concerned over the intensifying conflict in the region, including the siege of Dien Bien Phu. The Americans insist we do not have the credibility, firepower, or political will to achieve a victory. They insist our continued operations only risk further strengthening Vietnamese support for the communists. However, our top military and intelligence officials are calling us to refuse the demand, especially after the success of Operation Condor, which gravely weakened communist supply lines and infrastructure. The generals are confidant with a little more effort, victory can be achieved. The Foreign Minister is not as optimistic and warns if we refuse the Americans, they may choose to cut off aid to France, which could cripple the economy."
USA_FRAIND.2.d:0 "France indicated it agrees with our call for their withdrawal from Indochina. The French government stated it recognizes the situation on the ground is untenable and it will soon begin the process of opening talks with all relevant parties and preparing for a withdrawal of its forces. This is a major diplomatic victory as the CIA and State Department were growing increasingly worried that continued French occupation would strengthen the credibility of communists and weaken anti-communist or pro-Western factions among the Vietnamese people."
USA_FRAIND.3.d:0 "France has rejected our call for their withdrawal from Indochina. The French argued that due to recent successes on the ground, it could not halt its operations or withdraw while in a position of strength. The French emphasized that a withdrawal at this stage would abandon those people in the region who support them and enable a power vacuum the communists will exploit to their advantage. The continued French stubbornness continues to alienate regional states and Western reputation abroad, we may have to consider more harsh measures to bring the French to their senses."
Establish_SEATO.1.d:0 "During a Council of Ministers meeting in Bangkok, the Southeast Asia Treaty Association (SEATO) was formally established. The organization is a consequence of the recently signed Manilla Pact which called for its signatories to form SEATO in order to bolster bilateral ties and encourage collective security in the face of increasing regional communist aggression. The organization will be headquartered in Bangkok and hopes to attract more anti-communist regional states. The United States are major supporters of the effort and expressed hopes for the organization to emerge as a regional NATO. Although plans for cultural and military exchanges were discussed, the meeting did not agree on establishing any joint military commands. The Chinese government expressed reservations about the organization, calling it a pointless imperialist attempt to destroy the Chinese revolution."
Establish_SEATO.2.d:0 "The United States has offered us membership to SEATO. The organization is meant to strengthen bilateral ties between member states and coordinate collective security against Chinese aggression in the region. Joining the organization will provide opportunities to expand relations with those states, especially trade ties and cultural exchanges. Militarily, the organization does not have joint military commands but does hold regular meetings with senior defense officials which could give our armed forces professional development. However, joining the organization may make us a target of communist states. Our own domestic population may not be comfortable with the idea of collective security and oppose potential efforts to integrate the military responses of the group."
Establish_SEATO.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our invitation to join SEATO. They have pledged to attend the next Council of Ministers meeting to formalize its membership. They have informed us the organization aligns with their foreign policy and objectives. They were particularly excited about the prospect of increasing cultural and trade ties with the other member states. This is a major victory for our foreign policy and SEATO will benefit from its newest member. The response from the press is very positive as many in the country see the growth of SEATO as confirmation of our robust foreign policy."
Establish_SEATO.4.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has declined our invitation to join SEATO. They claim discomfort over the prospect of being so closely linked with the organization along with domestic concerns. It was iterated that the rejection of membership did not mean a rejection of our position or friendship. [FROM.GetName] has determined joining the organization would potentially cause more problems than benefits. This is a setback for sure, but we will continue to look for potential new members to strengthen the defense against the looming threat of communism in Asia."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.1.d:0 "The United States recently proposed expanding the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is designed to contain communist influence in the middle east. Its members enjoy increased bilateral ties and better access to Western aid. The American proposal would seek to bring in more middle east states and strengthen CENTO to face not just communist threats but also other radical ideologies in the region. Its legitimacy as a regional alliance would be strengthened. Pro-American Arab states will be targeted to bring more Arab states to the organization. Bringing more Arab state will also quash accusations the organization is not representative of the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.2.d:0 "We recently received an invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is meant to be a middle east version of NATO and prevent communist expansion in the region. The United State and Britain provide military and economic aid to the group. Members enjoy increased bilateral and cultural ties. Joining the organization could increase access to Western aid. It would solidify our place in the Western camp. However, joining the organization could have domestic ramifications and radicalize both leftists and Arab nationalist in the country."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.3.d:0 "The Lebanese government has declined membership to the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Lebanon stated they respected the invitation and carefully considered it. However, due to domestic concerns and the feelings of the Lebanese people, it must decline. This is a major blow for the United States which hopes to expand CENTO in order to bring more Arab states to better respond to radical ideological threat to the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.4.d:0 "The Lebanese government announced its excitement to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Joining the organization will bring Lebanon access to more Western aid. Lebanon expressed its hopes of expanding bilateral and cultural ties with all member states. CENTO and the United States view this as a major victory, Lebanon brings one of the largest centers of Arab culture in the organization, providing CENTO greater legitimacy in the region. Arab states in the region are condemning Lebanon and accusing it of betraying the Arab people for an imperial puppet alliance."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.5.d:0 "Lebanon responded positively to the invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). This is a great victory for the organization which we helped setup in order to contain communist influence in the region. Though the organization was meant to promote collective defense in the region but has not really gotten beyond being a forum for closer bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges. With Lebanon joining the organization, it will quiet regional criticism of the group being an imperial project promoted by us and Britain. It will also give the organization a stronger ability to deal with the rise of more radical ideologies in the region, like Arab nationalism."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.6.d:0 "We recently received an invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is meant to be a middle east version of NATO and prevent communist expansion in the region. Britain and the United States provide military and economic aid to the group. Members enjoy increased bilateral and cultural ties. Joining the organization could increase access to Western aid. It would solidify our place in the Western camp. It could strengthen the pro-Western inclinations of the monarchy, however it could backfire and radicalize both leftists and Arab nationalist in the country, especially in the military."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.7.d:0 "The Jordanian government has declined membership to the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Jordan stated they respected the invitation and carefully considered it. However, due to domestic concerns and the feelings of the Jordanian people, it must decline. This is a major blow for the United States which hopes to expand CENTO in order to bring more Arab states to better respond to radical ideological threat to the region. For Jordan, it will likely strengthen its image among Arab nationalists both domestically and in the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.8.d:0 "The Jordanian government announced its excitement to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Joining the organization will bring Jordan greater access to more Western aid. Jordan expressed its hopes of expanding bilateral and cultural ties with all member states. CENTO and the United States view this as a major victory, Jordan brings one of the more influential Arab states in the organization, giving CENTO greater legitimacy. Arab states in the region are condemning Jordan and accusing it of betraying the Arab people for an imperial puppet alliance and bribes."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.9.d:0 "Jordan responded positively to the invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). This is a great victory for the organization which we helped setup in order to contain communist influence in the region. Though the organization was meant to promote collective defense in the region but has not really gotten beyond being a forum for closer bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges. With Jordan joining the organization, it will quiet regional criticism of the group being an imperial project promoted by us and Britain. It will also give the organization a stronger ability to deal with the rise of more radical ideologies in the region, like Arab nationalism."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.10.d:0 "The United States accepted an invitation to officially join Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) and no longer be an observer. This gives the organization much greater access to Western aid and reduces the burden on Britain to meet the needs of CENTO. The CENTO members are said to be thrilled with the announcement and look forward to hosting senior American officials in future conferences. For the United States, a strong CENTO will protect its interests in the region and provide it a strong alliance to combat anti-Western or communist-friendly regimes. Critics in the region are condemning the action, calling it proof that CENTO is an imperial project. Joining the organization will lessen the need to support Israel directly to achieve our objectives. Our membership may help transform the organization into a true NATO for the middle east."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.11.d:0 "The United States has declined an invitation to upgrade its status from an observer to a member of the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Although the organization is meant to defend the middle east from communist encroachment, it has struggled to evolve beyond a forum of bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges among members. In the wider middle east, the organization is seen as an imperial project. The State Department is not confident our membership will evolve the group and in fact worry it will further erode its legitimacy in the region. Israel has also not been particularly fond of the group and pro-Israeli officials note supporting Israel will be a far more effective way to achieve regional objectives. For these reasons, the United States decided not to join."
