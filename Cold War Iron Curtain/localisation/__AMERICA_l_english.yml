 Formosa_Resolution.1.d:0 "The United States Senate passed a joint-resolution called the Formosa Resolution. It states that the President has the authority, at his discretion, to deploy the United States military to secure and protect Formosa (Taiwan) and its surrounding islands in response to any armed attacks by communists. The resolution is being celebrated across Taiwan as its people have long felt the threat of a mainland communist attack. The Taiwanese government pledged to remain steadfast in its defiance of the communists and thanked America for standing with the forces for a democratic China. The Peoples Republic of China condemned the resolution as the first step of America trying to turn Formosa into a colony and imperialist base to attack the revolution. Many Americans support the resolution as demonstrating the commitment of the United States to defend the global community from communism."
Fat_Fucker.1.d:0 "The CIA director, Secretary of State, and top Agency operatives have developed a plan called Project FF, or Project Fat Fucker. The United States recognizes the current political organization in Egypt is unstable and heavily corrupt. If things continue, there is a high risk of a leftist revolution in the country. The plan calls for the CIA to approach King Farouk and put heavy pressure on him to initiate crucial reforms. Ultimately the goal is for the King to reform his government, spread royal authority to efficient ministers, curb corruption and offer a progressive vision for the Egyptian people. If the King refuses to change, then alternatives to his government must be considered, such as the Free Officers, a clandestine movement within armed forces of anti-royal officers interested in establishing a new, nationalist state."
Fat_Fucker.2.d:0 "The United States has approached the King and offered a dire warning. They claim if the current political situation continues, Egypt risks unrest and the overthrow of the monarchy. The Americans are insisting the King implement reforms, curb corruption, and assert his authority over the government. The reforms include giving royal authority to officials and military officers. The Americans essentially want the King to cut ties with some of his close friends, curtail some of his extracurricular interests, and establish a more progressive royal government under the guidance of trained bureaucrats and military officers. The King must decide to accept this pressure and risk his throne to foreign and domestic influence, or stay the course and maintain Egyptian sovereignty."
Fat_Fucker.3.d:0 "The King has acquiesced to American pressure on instituting critical reforms to his government and administration in order to prevent potential unrest or even uprisings. Close advisors to the King are drawing up the relevant orders and bringing in senior civil service and military officers for more prominent roles in the regime. However, although the King has agreed, it remains to be seen how deeply he will remain committed to these reforms. Regardless, the King claims he is acting in the best interests of the Egyptian people and the monarchy. Although the government media is publicizing a new initiative conceived by the King, there are already rumors across Egypt that the King is acting under American pressure. It appears some palace officials, conscious that the reforms will spell their decline, are openly spreading the word."
Fat_Fucker.4.d:0 "Project FF appears to be well on its way to success as King Farouk has indicated a willingness to agree with reforms. However, it is not the first time he has promised reforms but balked to go all the way. Regardless, the CIA and State Department are happy that the King was willing to accept our proposals in principle. The next stage will be to continue pressuring King Farouk until he implements all the reforms and establishes a secure, anti-communist, Egyptian state. Intelligence analysts argue we must continue the pressure on the King. There are fears however, that as word spreads that the King has agreed on reforms, which include giving more power to military officers, anti-royal nationalists in the military, may see this as an opportunity for their own agendas."
Fat_Fucker.5.d:0 "Our efforts to pressure King Farouk into initiating crucial reforms has failed. The King remains steadfast in his own delusions of grandeur and believes our advice is a ploy to establish American dominance in the country. Operation Ff appears to have failed to persuade the King, however, the objective to establish a strong, anti-communist Egyptian regime has not. The CIA has contacts with a group of nationalist, anti-royal military officers called the Free Officers. We can provide this group clandestine support and ensure their protection from counter-coups once they act against King Farouk. The President has directed the State Department and CIA to refocus its efforts on supporting the Free Officers to ensure when King Farouk inevitably falls, he will not be replaced by a leftist, pro-Moscow regime."
Project_FF.1.d:0 "The CIA has initiated an operation to spread information to the international press emphasizing the danger King Farouk of Egypt poses to the middle east. There are an increasing number of reports on Egypt discussing their desire to destroy Israel and rival Arab powers by any means necessary. Congressional allies, among other sources, have "leaked" specially curated intelligence reports suggesting Egypt is preparing to go bankrupt to acquire arms in order to launch attacks against neighboring states. Our agents in Egypt are spreading pamphlets and articles denouncing the corruption and moral bankruptcy of King Farouk in order to undermine his domestic base."
Project_FF.2.d:0 "There is increasing alarm across the United States and Europe over intelligence reports suggesting King Farouk of Egypt is preparing to launch military attacks against Israel and other neighboring states. The reports emphasize the delusional nature of Farouk and suggest he will take Egypt to bankruptcy in order to rapidly acquire arms to achieve his ambitions. Many American officials and their allies abroad note such a scenario is likely and renewed conflict in the region could result in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The Egyptian government denounces the accusations, accusing the West of launching a propaganda campaign against the Arab people."
US_Navy50s.1.d:0 "The United States Navy has held a series of high-level talks among senior officers and national defense leaders to articulate a more modern, proactive doctrine. The United States Navy believes it must deploy fleets across the oceans and position forces that can quickly arrive on the scene of any emerging international crisis. This will enable the United States more international maneuverability as it can quickly establish a forward presence and force projection. To better enact such a strategy, the Navy will required continued and extensive financial support from the government."
CIA_DOM_50s.1.d:0 "The CIA does not have domestic policing powers and is forbidden from spying on Americans at home. However, it does have a National Resources Division with a domestic focus. The NRD oversees several programs for voluntary debriefings of Americans in order to collect public intelligence and the Office of Current Intelligence which gives high-level briefings. However, the agency is rumored to be involved in other operations meant to experiment certain technologies, theories and efforts at influence public opinion. Such operations are critical in strengthening the capabilities of the agency in coming years, but the CIA plans on keeping its operations away from the public to avoid legal challenges."
CIA_DOM_50s.2.d:0 "Near the end of the war, our intelligence agencies discovered advanced and at times terrifying experiments by the Japanese and Germans involving the manipulation and control of the human mind. Many Nazis involved in such programs were arrested by our forces and after the war were employed to continue their studies. Our recent skirmishes with communist forces confirmed they were using their own techniques and experimenting on American prisoners of war. This is unacceptable and we cannot fall behind. As such, the Central Intelligence Agency recently launched Project MKUltra, which will experiment and study the use of specific drugs in order to improve interrogations and explore mind control. The CIA plans to launch tests on military personnel, employees, sex workers, prisoners, and mental patients in order to avoid public scrutiny as some Agency lawyers believe these experiments may violate laws regarding the CIA presence domestically."
CIA_DOM_50s.3.d:0 "Mass media is increasingly becoming a vital medium in how people across the globe consume news. The Soviets are already influencing and manipulating the media to further their political objectives and undermine the United States. To combat this foreign influence and subversion, the CIA recently initiated Operation Mockingbird. CIA agents are recruiting leading American journalists and influential civil groups in order to coordinate an effective response to the Soviet efforts. More importantly, the CIA can help propagate our own media offensives to better persuade the American and international community of our just cause and prevent the infiltration of foreign influence or American communists."
USA_Suez.5.d:0 "The London Stock Exchange has collapsed following news that the United States would begin calling in its war debt from the United Kingdom. This comes after the British government refused demands from Washington to halt its intervention in the Suez. The joint Anglo-French-Israeli invasion, launched after Egypt nationalized the Suez canal, caught the United States off guard. Many American leaders are likening the military action to colonial era gunboat diplomacy which has no role in the modern world and undermines the image of the West across the region. The decision to call in the war debt is leading to widespread panic across Britain, but it may be just the first action. If Britain continues the war, America may soon cut off economic aid, which would be disastrous to a nation still rebuilding from World War II."
USA_KOR_WITHDRAWAL.1.d:0 "The United States has begun withdrawing its forces from Korea. The President announced his decision after a high-level meeting with senior military and defense leaders. The President concluded that the American people had sacrificed and given all it could in supporting the cause of freedom in Korea. However, to stay on would be to sacrifice lives for no reasonable gain and it is time for the people of Korea to standup and fight for their own freedom. The news is being viewed as a fatal setback for the South Koreans and United Nations forces, as the loss of American forces now shift the balance of power noticeably to North Korea. The South Korean government and American allies have harshly criticized the American decision."
Albanian_Subversion.1.d:0 "The British SIS has approached us about a plan to overthrow the communist regime in Albania. The British believe that Enver Hoxha, the communist leader, is still in the process of consolidating his regime and there exists an opportunity to stop the communist expansion. The British believe, with our support, they can parachute highly trained anti-communist Albanian expats to the Mati region of the country. Mati is known for its conservatism and strong ties with the former royal family. The British believe the agents could organize a mass revolt and with supply drops, they can eventually overthrow Hoxha and end the communist threat."
Albanian_Subversion.5.d:0 "The British has helped establish the Free Albania National Committee. The organization consists of anti-communist Albanians living in the west. With this organization, we hope to recruit and organize these Albanian activists for the upcoming operation. The group will send the most promising members to the British for extensive training and preparation for the planned operation. Efforts to attract support for the organization from King Zog have stalled as the former monarch is not willing to compromise on his stance that he is the sole representative of Albanians. The CIA is not willing to be overly involved as they are concerned of the presence of formerly pro-Axis Albanian anti-communist exiles."
Albanian_Subversion.6.d:0 "The British government has approached the CIA for cooperation on its plans for instigating an anti-communist uprising in Albania. The British have established ties with the Free Albania National Committee. Through the organization, the group can provide agents to instigate the operation. However, the British have failed to bring the support of the former Albanian monarch, King Zog. The CIA believes the British have put in a lot of preparation but are concerned over the lack of royal support and presence of former pro-Axis Albanian exiles. Some in the Agency believe it may be a stronger approach to instead go our own way and work with King Zog to orchestrate a royalist uprising."
Albanian_Subversion.7.d:0 "The CIA has declined to cooperate with the proposed Albanian operation. They believe King Zog is the strongest route to provoke an anti-communist uprising. They have expressed skepticism over the feasibility of the SIS plan without backing from King Zog. The British are said to be very disappointed by this result and unsure how to proceed as they needed American bases and airpower for their plan. The CIA hopes the SIS will come around but are confident it will be able to succeed with King Zog."
Albanian_Subversion.8.d:0 "The United States recently launched a diplomatic and media campaign to condemn the Albanian communist regime of Enver Hoxha. The American government is calling for self-determination and accuse the communists of suppressing the rights of all Albanians. The CIA is also supporting the effort by pressing its allies in the international media to publicize reports of communist suppression and statements by anti-communist Albanian exiles. The effort is meant to undermine the communist regime and provide international support for future regime change."
Albanian_Subversion.9.d:0 "The United States announced it would resettle Albanian refugees in the country. The American government stated these refugees are victims of communist aggression and under threat in Europe. The public declaration is meant to expose the human rights situation in communist controlled Albania. For the CIA, the arrival of refugees will allow the organization to strengthen its ties with anti-communist Albanians and identify future operatives and political allies."
Albanian_Subversion.10.d:0 "The Assembly of Captive European Nations has organized in New York City under the supervision of the United States and private guidance from the CIA. The organization brings together anti-communist exiles from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. The organization pledges to liberate their home countries through peaceful means and publicize the reality of life behind the cruel Iron Curtain. Along with the publication of periodicals and newspaper articles, the organization plans on opening branch offices in England, France, and Switzerland. The Soviet Union and its allies will be monitoring the group closely."
Albanian_Subversion.11.d:0 "The Albanian anti-communist revolt, led by Albanian exiles who returned to liberate their country, welcomed the return of King Zog to Tirana. The King had been living in exile since being forced to flee the country following the invasion of Italy in 1939. Although criticized for taking much of the gold reserves of Albania, though he has promised to return it and claimed he had only taken it to protect its theft by foreign powers. The anti-communist uprising drew its largest supporters from regions that remained loyal to the King. While addressing a massive crowd of supporters, King Zog promised to restore Albanian dignity and wealth. Communist neighboring states have condemned the return of King Zog, calling it the beginning of a reactionary nightmare for the people of Albania. The United States and its allies welcome the return of King Zog as a restoration of political freedom to the people of Albania."
US_STEEL.0.d:0 "The price of steel in the United States has seen a dramatic increase. This has raised the concern of President [USA.GetLeader] and his economic advisors. They believe the steel industry, especially dominated by the U.S. Steel corporation, is coordinating its efforts to increase the price of steel to maximize profits. The President believes the price increases will risk an inflationary crisis and could weaken the defense industry if a crisis were to emerge. He is believed to be considering the breakup of U.S. Steel as a way to promote more economic competition and lower prices. However, he would have to consider the potential consequences and legal challenges such an action would cause. U.S. Steel argues the prices are due to the market and increased worker wages. It strongly opposes any attempt at federal interference in its operations."
US_STEEL.5.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] recently directed the government to investigate U.S. Steel for manipulating the market while directing his legal team to begin anti-trust lawsuits to break up the corporation. The President stated that U.S. Steel possessed an unfair monopoly in the steel market and had stifled competition. He proposed the corporation could either go through a series of lawsuits and investigations, or it could simply agree to breakup. After a board meeting, U.S. Steel responded by agreeing to the demands of the President and initiated plans to split the company. The President is facing criticism for what many business leaders call an overreach of executive power, however, many Americans applaud the President for his efforts to protect consumers and promote competition in business."
US_STEEL.6.d:0 "When asked questions about the surge in steel prices, President [USA.GetLeader] stated that while he felt for the American people and industries dependent on steel, this was the price of a free economy. When asked about calls in the press for the President to intervene to force prices down or breakup major steel corporations, the President stated this was not an option. In its own statement, U.S. Steel reiterated that the current price hike was not part of an elaborate scheme but the result of the current market prices and demand."
Decolonization_USA.50.d:0 "A recent speech by the President of the United States has raised eyebrows in capitals across Western Europe. The President condemned European colonialism as a denial to the inalienable rights of colonized people to self-determination and freedom. He noted, continued colonialism only held up archaic systems and radicalized populations against the liberties and progress Democracy offered the world. He called on all European powers with colonies to begin the process of decolonization and help usher in a new global order of free trade, democracy, and cooperation in Africa and Asia."
Korean_War_Yan.1.d:0 "The United States has requested our forces launch an immediate operation to liberate Yunnan from the communists. The United States recently started a war with the communist regime and appear committed to destroying it. The Americans stated their appreciation of our commitment to democracy in China and believe our operations would greatly aid their efforts to defeat the communists. Many of the commanders believe we should act now in the interest of China and to tie down Chinese forces. However, some of the commanders are urging caution, saying we would be operating outside the main American forces and would risk the annihilation of our forces. They believe we should decline the request and enter Yunnan at the time and place of our choosing."
Korean_War_Yan.2.d:0 "The Republic of China forces operating in Burma have agreed to our request for them to launch operations in Yunnan. This is welcome news for our operations. The Chinese will be stretched thin to defend its coast and borders, giving us the option to strike at their weak points. It will also legitimize our mission as liberators of China and champions to its democratic forces. We can expect reports of YANSA offensives in the coming days."
Korean_War_Yan.3.d:0 "The Republic of China forces operating in Burma have declined our request for them to launch operations in Yunnan. This is a major setback for our war efforts. The participation of YANSA forces would have stretched the communists thin and given greater flexibility to our operations. The CIA believes the YANSA commanders were concerned of casualties and perhaps have grown too comfortable in their bases and control of the local drug trade."
Korean_War_Yan.4.d:0 "Reports from China and Burma indicate that the remnants of the Republic of China's Eigth Army has launched an invasion of communist China through the Yunnan province. The Peoples Republic of China promised an immediate retaliation and have downplayed the threat. However, this invasion may end up being disastrous as the communists will now have to commit troops to Yunnan as it engages in a direct war with the United States. The American government welcomed the news, calling it an intervention of a liberation force seeking to end communist tyranny."
Decolonization_USA.2.d:0 "In a recent address, the President called for the decolonization of Africa. The President stated the American people have always supported the cause of liberty and freedom. In pursuance of these values, the end of colonialism and freedom for all Africans is a vital interest to the United States. He ended the address by urging those nations still holding colonies to recognize decolonization is the only just path forward. The address will no doubt cause concern among the colonial powers, but the American government believes it has gained new friends and legitimacy across the African continent. Many anti-colonial organizations have welcomed the news. American businesses and economists are also showing support as ending colonial rule will open new markets for American goods and influence."
Decolonization_USA.3.d:0 "The shift to embrace decolonization, at the risk of alienating powerful allies reflects a return to Wilsonian diplomacy. The American State Department announced the United States firmly supports self-determination for all colonized peoples. This new American effort is meant to strengthen American ties with the newly emerging states and challenge the Soviets as the champion of anti-colonialism in Africa. Privately, the Soviets are said to be concerned over this challenge and there are fears among some Soviet leaders that the Americans may spread this self-determination stance to Soviet influenced areas in Europe and Asia."
Decolonization_USA.4.d:0 "The State Department announced the United States intends to invite newly independent African states to join the Technical Assistance Program. The American government believes the program will provide key technical assistance to aid the transformation of these states into stable, democratic nations. This invitation continues the recent American embrace of decolonization and many see the Technical Assistance Program as a way for America to improve its influence in the continent and curb the threat of communist influence."
Decolonization_USA.1.d:0 "The situation in Africa is rapidly changing. Across the continent, millions are advocating either for greater self-rule or independence from colonial powers. The expansion of education and more radical ideologies in colonies is fueling anti-colonial activism. The State Department believes European powers continuing to hold colonies, even with force, risk radicalizing their colonial subjects and opening the path to communist influence. Some believe the United States must use its leverage over European colonial states to push decolonization, in order to prevent radicalization and open these territories to American cultural and economic influence. However, another group argues such an approach will only facilitate the rise of radical regimes and instead they urge the United States to more openly support colonial states. We can encourage them to implement reforms so they can eventually transfer power to local, pro-Western African elites."
Radio_Free_Europe.1.d:0 "The National Committee for a Free Europe (NCFE) recently launched a new radio station called Radio Free Europe. This new station will conduct broadcasts across Europe and the Iron Curtain to battle communist propaganda. The CIA controls the NCFE and has recruited many prominent anti-communists to support its efforts. Radio Free Europe will broadcast accounts from refugees who have escaped communist regimes. The station is being widely applauded across the United States as a strong response to the rising communist threat."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.2.d:0 "The failed attempt to oust the government of Jacobo Arbenz has resulted in him strengthening his hold over the country. With this stronger support, he will no doubt expand efforts to seize lands and facilities of American interests like United Fruit Company in the country. The CIA believes this will inevitably lead to a transformation of Guatemala into a Soviet client. However, this is not occurring yet. In order to not lose Guatemala and act before the situation is completely untenable, the CIA has a plan to leak certain intelligence in a way to make it appear the Soviets are already making moves to enter the country. Once the American people see Guatemala is on the verge of hosting Soviet forces, we can deploy the military to secure the country."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.1.d:0 "The failure of the CIA to control the situation in Guatemala reflects a wider failure of the Monroe Doctrine. For decades, the Monroe Doctrine has secured our interest and region from hostile ideologies or foreign interference. However, the recent failure highlights the limitations of American influence and now Guatemala is at risk of becoming a Soviet client. Our failure in Guatemala is an open signal to anti-American forces across the hemisphere to begin operations and plans to carry out their own agendas. American allies have also lost faith in our protection and may seek to look elsewhere for support."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.3.d:0 "Reports are spreading across the American and Western press of increasing Soviet influence over the Guatemalan government of Jacobo Arbenz. The reports indicate the Soviets are planning on quickly establishing a relationship with the country and establishing bases in the country. Editorials are already calling for the President to act. The American people are not comfortable with Soviet troops being deployed only miles from the United States. The President is gaining the necessary public backing to take more drastic action to resolve the Guatemalan situation."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.50.d:0 "The leftist regime in Guatemala has solidified its control over the country and instituted draconian measures to curb dissent and setup the further nationalization of foreign companies in the country, especially United Fruit Company, a vital American corporation. The CIA responded with operation PBSuccess, which sought to establish radio broadcasts and instill widespread fear and panic among the Guatemalan people. In this chaotic environment, the Guatemalan military, with its pro-American and anti-communist leadership, would be able to rally even pro-government officers to intervene and end the regime of Jacob Arbenz. However, this plan failed. Once news was leaked of an impending Soviet deployment, the President was able to order the United States military to invade Guatemala to restore democracy and protect American citizens and property in the country, with the support of the American people."
USA_Israel_Lobby.1.d:0 "The situation in the Middle East is precarious. Although the recent Arab-Israeli War has ended in an armistice, both sides appear to be gearing up for a second round of fighting. The Arab World possess valuable resources, especially oil. The Israelis are establishing a democratic state and has a strong affinity towards the West and has the sympathy of the American people. The administration must decide how it will proceed. One group advocates a strong pro-Israel policy including arms deals, this will be well-received by the public and pro-Israeli interests. The Israelis could also help secure our interests in the region. However, doing so would risk Arab ire and access to oil. The other group believes we must maintain neutrality in order to maintain and grow ties with Arab states. From this position we could help broker a future agreement to the long-term benefit of both the Israelis and Arabs."
USA_Israel_Lobby.2.d:0 "The United States, Britain, and France have signed the Tripartite Declaration. The three states pledge to maintain the territorial status quo of as established by the recent Arab-Israeli Armistice agreements. The agreement confirms the commitment of these states to peace and stability in the Middle East and prevent any side from destabilizing the precarious peace. The agreement is being welcomed by the Arab states, desperately rebuilding their military capabilities. The Israelis are said to be upset as they believe their military advantage will soon be lost as the three states also agreed to limit arms sales to the region."
USA_Israel_Lobby.3.d:0 "The United States has refused to sign a proposed Tripartite Declaration proposed by Britain in France. The agreement would call on all three state to preserve the current territorial status quo between Israel and its Arab neighbors. It would also have stipulated the three parties would work to control arms sales to the region. The American government argued the agreement was anti-Israeli as it would deny them access to defense aid while allowing Arab states to more effectively rearm on the global market with its stronger financial position. The American rejection indicates its support for Israel and the Arab states are said to be furious over their position."
Ajax_USA.5.d:0 "The State Department announced the United States strongly opposes the recent nationalization of foreign oil interests in Iran. Such unilateral actions hinder the potential of future investment in Iran and unfairly punish those with interests in these corporations. The United States urges Iran to reconsider its approach and return to the negotiating table to reach a just resolution. The announcement is being welcomed by the British who continue to try and rally international support for its position."
Ajax_USA.6.d:0 "The President of the United States informed the National Security Council that America would not militarily intervene in Iran. The President stated his hope that both Britain and Iran can resolve their disputes peacefully. At this stage, a military escalation would only cause more suffering and greatly weaken the image of the United States abroad. The British government was also informed of this decision and they are expected to be disappointed. If Britain were to launch its own military operations, it would do so at the risk of provoking a negative American reaction."
Ajax_USA.15.d:0 "The President has directed the State Department to criticize British involvement in Iranian affairs. The United States cannot condone such blatant interference as it risks enflaming tensions in the region. It would also weaken Western prestige among post-colonial states. The CIA is being directed to cut off any cooperation with the British over intelligence operations in Iran. If the British insist on its current course, it will have to do so on its own."
Ajax_USA.7.d:0 "The British failure to overthrow the Iranian government has caused it to consider more drastic measures to prevent the nationalization of oil and further erosion of valuable Western interests in the country. The British are now calling on us to support them both militarily and politically in an invasion of Iran. Supporting an invasion and new regime could firmly cement Western control of a key regional state and strengthen British ties. The British also argue the current Iranian government is close to the communist Tudeh Party and if not removed, Iran may be the victim of a Soviet sponsored communist coup. However, such an invasion may have other consequences, such as radicalizing Iranian opposition to us and provoking a wider, regional backlash. The potential reaction of the Soviets must also be considered."
Ajax_USA.8.d:0 "The United States has agreed to our proposal to remove the Iranian government through military action. The current regime in Tehran is clearly under the thrall of the pro-Soviet Tudeh. It is only a matter of time before a Soviet sponsored coup sees Iran become a Soviet satellite. If this were to occur, the Soviets would be in the heart of the middle east. The nationalization efforts and anti-British demonstrations are proof of communist influence. With American support, we can expect a swift victory and diplomatic cover in our operations."
Ajax_USA.9.d:0 "The United States has rejected our proposal to remove the Iranian government through military action. The current regime in Tehran is clearly under the thrall of the pro-Soviet Tudeh. It is only a matter of time before a Soviet sponsored coup sees Iran become a Soviet satellite. If this were to occur, the Soviets would be in the heart of the middle east. The Americans are choosing to ignore the dangerous implications of the recent nationalization efforts and anti-British demonstrations. If necessary, we may need to remove the Iranian threat ourselves, but this will likely result in American diplomatic objections."
Containment_Policy.1.d:0 "The biggest challenge to global order is the rise of radical communist movements across Europe and Asia following 1945. The Soviet Union is blatantly supporting these efforts and are offering arms, training, and cash to these organizations to subvert and overthrow democratic regimes. In territories under Soviet military occupation they have simply purged non-communist political parties and forcibly established communist regimes. To combat this, the United States is establishing alliances among the frontline states facing communists and encouraging collective defense. American military, economic, and political aid will protect these states from overt and covert communist threats. The goal is to surround the communist world and contain it from further expansion."
USA_CWC.1.d:0 "The Chinese Civil War is raging, the Republic of China is struggling to stop the communist Peoples Republic of China. The years of internal conflicts and World War II have sapped much of the Republic of China strength. We must consider our options to approaching the situation. One option is to let things play out, our involvement may only prolong the fighting, bolster the communists, or deplete our own strength. The other option is to approach the United Nations to rally international cooperation in resolving the conflict in favor of the Republic of China. Finally, we can simply intervene directly. We can provide advisors, equipment, and if necessary, a military intervention to save the Chinese people from communist tyranny."
CCW_USA.10.d:0 "In a somber address, the President informed the American people that the United States military would be intervening in the Chinese Civil War. The President said the Republic of China had been a close ally to the United States during the last war, holding the line against the Japanese Empire at tremendous cost. He also noted the close bonds made by the two sides during the war, including the sacrifice of many Chinese lives to protect and host American airmen. He concluded by stating the communists were seeking to exploit an exhausted Chinese nation with its nefarious operations and the people of China needed direct American help to ensure the freedom of its people."
CWC_Police_Action.1.d:0 "The United States has presented a resolution at the United Nations Security Council calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The United States claims the PRC has continuously violated international norms and engaged in gross crimes against its own people. A successful UN vote would give legitimacy for military action against PRC and help establish an international coalition. The only obstacle to the resolution is the Soviet Union, which has veto power on the security council."
CWC_Police_Action.2.d:0 "The United States recently presented a resolution to the United Nations Security Council calling for police against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The United States is trying to build international consensus on its proposed military operations. The PRC is a communist state, however, their leadership at times has been erratic and has shown a desire to eventually challenge our leadership of the communist world. They have at times questioned our revolutionary path. It maybe in our interest to abstain from the vote and allow our two rivals to weaken themselves in armed conflict. However, China is a major communist state and not using our veto could result in a major reversal for communism in Asia."
CWC_Police_Action.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union used its veto power to halt the United States resolution calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). This is a major blow for the Americans who wanted to garner international support for military action. The other communist states are praising our action for defending socialism. The West will no doubt be infuriated but this is nothing new. The PRC also expressed their satisfaction and we can look forward to better relations for the near future."
CWC_Police_Action.4.d:0 "In a surprise move, the Soviet Union elected to abstain from the United Nations Security Council resolution calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). This is a major victory for the United States, which proposed the resolution. Although Soviet allies are not outright condemning the action, many leftist and communist movements have already expressed outrage over the action. The PRC has also condemned the Soviet decision and are openly questioning their revolutionary credentials. The United States will now be able to carry out its military objectives with regards to the PRC."
USA_VIE50s.3.d:0 "The CIA director presented a plan to the President on a way to ensure the ballots are rigged in our favor in the upcoming Reunification Elections in Vietnam. We have established a fairly robust intelligence network in the country. The plan will involve cash, incentives, and some clandestine manipulation of the votes to ensure a democratic victory for the people of Vietnam. However, such an operation may be uncovered and could have drastic consequences in the region. To not act would risk us losing the entire country and potentially the region to a new wave of communism."
Vietnam_RefferendumAH.5.d:0 "The people of Vietnam voted to reject unification. It appears the people of South Vietnam have no interest in being unified and under the control of communist North Vietnam. The results are being welcomed by the American backed South Vietnamese government who argued the North Vietnam government lacked sincerity in holding free elections. The North Vietnamese government has accused the South and its allies of manipulating the results to ensure it did not result in unification and the establishment of a true government that represents the people of Vietnam. They are calling for all the people of Vietnam to express their displeasure and pledged to redouble their efforts in liberating all Vietnamese people."
USA_VIE50s.2.d:0 "The United States has agreed to plans for Reunification Elections in Vietnam that came out of the recently signed Geneva Accords. The agreement came after assurances from the communist north that the election will be overseen by international observers. Our agreement means the South Vietnamese will have to go along with it despite their reservations. The CIA also claims it is unsure how the election will turn out. Regardless, denying the election may only make the southern government unpopular and turn the Vietnamese public overwhelmingly in support of the communists, who claim to represent the nation." 
USA_VIE50s.4.d:0 "Following Reunification Elections, the people of Vietnam have decided to unite under a coalition government of the communist north and non-communist south. The results have seen thousands take to the streets in celebration, many Vietnamese see this as the end of their struggle for peace and independence. The CIA believes the coalition appears stable for now, but warn it may quickly unravel if either side seeks to expand their base. We will monitor the situation closely and work to ensure the communists do not use this as an opportunity to launch a coup and seize power from the freedom loving people of Vietnam."
USA_VIE50s.8.d:0 "The United States will back South Vietnam in its rejection of the Geneva Accords. The South Vietnamese believe the agreement gives the communists a base from which to undermine their government. More importantly, proposals for a Reunification Election are not tenable as the communists will clearly manipulate the vote in its favor, through all means at its disposal. The CIA agrees with this assessment and to ensure South Vietnam is not isolated, we are whole heartedly supporting their stance. The communists will have to make proper compromises and guarantee no subversion for any lasting agreement can be achieved."
American_Aid.5.d:0 "The President directed the Defense Department and State Department to shift aid earmarked for France to Korea and Japan. The United States has determined providing more support to Asia is much more important than focusing so much on Europe. France is a developed and strong nation, it will not be greatly hindered, though the French government will likely not respond well to our decision. The Japanese and Korean government are already expressing their thanks with our increased support. They are crucial frontline states against communism and must be supported."
American_Aid.6.d:0 "The United States announced it would shift aid meant for Britain, Australia, and other commonwealth states to India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The American government recognizes these states are under the risk of Soviet influence and this must be countered. The commonwealth states will be upset by our action, but they will not be overly affected by our actions. The action emphasizes our focus on securing the battle for influence in South Asia and the Pacific."
American_Aid.1.d:0 "The Mutual Security Act was recently passed in Congress. It is a new foreign aid program that will enable the United States to provide aid and grants to friendly states. The support will help those states develop their capabilities and more firmly be able to resist communist influence. Unlike earlier programs, the support will not be limited to any one region or state. It will give the President greater flexibility and strengthen the State Department as it continues to wage diplomatic battles to secure American influence against an increasingly belligerent Soviet foreign policy."
