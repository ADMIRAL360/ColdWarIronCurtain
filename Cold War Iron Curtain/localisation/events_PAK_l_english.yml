 Nazimuddin.1.d:0 "Khawaja Nazimuddin has agreed to become the second Prime Minister of Pakistan. The former Governor-General was seen by many to be the least controversial choice due to his record. As Governor-General he exercised political neutrality in politics. The fact that both Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan openly supported him before their deaths also made Nazimuddin the ideal candidate to become Prime Minister. Prime Minister Nazimuddin is from Dacca and will be the first Bengali head of government in Pakistan. Among his first acts was to make Malik Ghulam the new Governor-General. He comes to power amidst rising political discontent from provincial nationalists and has expressed he will continue the conservative approach of his predecessor. A new era of Pakistani politics has begun. However, critics are already noting his aristocratic background and the political backlash from his Basic Principles Report do not bode well for him." 
 Language_Debate.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin ignited controversy over his remarks in Dacca last month. He stated that Jinnah was right to say that for national unity, Urdu must be the only language for Pakistan. Although a Bengali, Nazimuddin remains staunchly committed to the Pakistan envisioned by Jinnah and his background as an Urdu-speaking aristocrat clouded his understanding of how sensitive the Bengali people were over the language issue. The announcement led to the formation of language committees demanding recognition for Bengali as a national language. Today, language demonstrators took to the streets of Dacca in massive numbers, despite a government ban on unlawful assembly. The protestors, mostly students, have met at the University and are gathering in large numbers. The police and East Pakistani authorities are ready to act." 
 Language_Debate.2.d:0 "At Dacca University where students were protesting over the language issue, police were able to cordon off areas and used tear gas to break up protestors. As students fled, some were detained for violating the government orders and this apparently enraged the crowd. This crowd moved to the East Pakistan Assembly Building to demand their grievances be heard and as they appeared to be storming into the building, police opened fire, killing at least six but likely more students. The news of the shooting had caused citizens in Dacca to start a general strike. Over the next two days more protestors took to the streets and there were more police shootings. Support for the government dwindles among the Bengalis as they turn increasingly to left-leaning parties. The leftists promise to support the will of the people and pledge to support the language movement." 

 PAK_Military.0.d:0 "A number of British military officers were retained following partition to fill the gaps and prepare officers to take important positions throughout the military command. During the recent Kashmir War, the British officers disobeyed government orders to deploy Pakistani troops to the front, greatly hindering the war-effort. The government believes removing these officers is essential for national security. To achieve this, the government recently announced it would offer British officers serving in the Pakistan Army only a one-year extension to their current contracts, set to expire soon. This has seen virtually all the British officers decline the extension and in response the government announced Pakistan would see the nationalization of the Army in a few months. The Air Force and Navy however, will retain many British officers out of necessity, but they will be phased out in the following years. The press has greatly welcomed this nationalization effort by the military. Pakistani Army officers are also excited of the prospect of rapid promotions to fill the new gaps." 
 PAK_Military.1.d:0 "The government of Pakistan has announced General Ayub Khan has assumed the responsibilities of Army Chief for the Pakistan Army. He is the first native service head and his promotion has led to great fanfare in the press. The tall, Pathan officer is the son of a colonial railroad official and was one of the first Indians to be commissioned in the British Indian Army after graduating from the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He served as a Colonel during World War II, leading operations in Burma. After the war he has held senior command positions in both West and East Pakistan. Upon taking over, the General pledged the loyalty of the Army to Pakistan and pledged he would lead efforts to begin incorporating ethnic groups long excluded from the military by the colonial state and build a truly national force for the nation. His comments were well-received by the press." 

 Bogra_PM.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin was removed from office by Governor-General Ghulam Malik who invoked special powers from the 1935 Government of India Act. Some welcome the decision as Nazimuddin proved ineffective during both the language debate, the riots in Lahore, and in stopping the increasing popularity of leftist parties in the country. However, others are uneasy about the Governor-General using powers put in place by the colonial regime to ensure they controlled the governance of India. To replace Nazimuddin, the Governor-General recalled the relatively unknown ambassador to the United States, Mohammad Ali Bogra and has convinced him to be the new Prime Minister. The appointment of a career diplomat has surprised the nation and many question if he will be able to manage the increasingly divided political landscape. However, a middle-class Bengali there is hope he can calm tensions in East Pakistan. Popular in Washington, the United States is said to be excited by the new PM." 
 Bogra_PM.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Ali Bogra at the Constituent Assembly laid out what is being called the Bogra Formula. The Prime Minister calls his proposals a political compromise for both wings of the country, it envisions a National Assembly based on proportional representation and a Senate with equal representation from the four provinces of West Pakistan, essentially ending one unit. He also proposed a formula for reserved seats which would ultimately lead to a parliament in which East Pakistan had more seats but through the reserved system, the West Pakistani representatives would balance out. Issues between the houses would be resolved in a joint session and the Governor-General position would lose many powers and the title would change to President. The compromise is being widely praised across the country However, the curbing of powers and shifting power towards the legislative branch is said to be making the Governor-General, military leaders, and civil service officers nervous."
 Bogra_PM.3.d:0 "Although Prime Minister Ali Bogra has worked very hard to finalize a constitution, both the one unit and his Bogra formula have stalled to facilitate a final constitution. The Constituent Assembly recently concluded that Governor-General Ghulam Malik has been hindering efforts at a political compromise in the country. In an effort to take control of the situation, the Prime Minister allowed the Constituent Assembly to discuss laws which would restrict the powers of the Governor-General and prevent him from dismissing the current government as he did with its predecessor. Ghulam Malik has responded by dismissing the Constituent Assembly, though he has not removed the Bogra government. Members of the assembly have taken the Governor-General to court over his action and in the midst of this political infighting, the Governor-General has asked for medical leave. Ghulam Malik has left the country for treatment abroad and the Interior Minister, career civil service officer Iskander Mirza has been appointed acting Governor-General." 
 Bogra_PM.4.d:0 "Iskandar Mirza, the acting Governor-General, immediately began conflicting with Prime Minister Ali Bogra. He felt Bogra and his plans for a constitutional compromise were going to dramatically increase the disparity of power between the provinces and lead the country to ruin. Prime Minister Ali Bogra was quite adamant that he wanted to give the country a constitution and began discussing with political allies plans to curb the powers of the Governor-General when a new assembly arrived. However, Mirza acted first, he announced the resignation of Prime Minister Ali Bogra and informed the Governor-General he had stepped in for, Ghulam Malik, that he was also dismissed. Although Ali Bogra officially resigned, many believe the Governor-General forced him to step down. The now former Prime Minister has returned to his former position as the ambassador to the United States. As a new legislative assembly begins to take form, many believe the new Governor-General will pick the political faction that guarantees his power." 
 
 Bohla_Cyclone.1.d:0 "As the aftermath of Tropical Storm Nora moved towards the Bay of Bengal, it slowly transformed into a cyclone called Bohla. The devastating storm hit East Pakistan directly, moving north before it ended in Assam. The storm has caused extensive casualties, with the number of deaths numbering in the tens of thousands. The Pakistan Meteorological Department failed to predict or warn the population of the storm, leading to even more losses. Although the Pakistan military in East Pakistan deployed aircraft, ships, and troops to provide relief, many Bengalis are furious with the government. The federal government has failed to coordinate a response, and many complain there are massive shortages in relief supplies. For many Bengalis, the perceived lackluster response is seen as confirmation to the second-class status East Pakistan is viewed as by the federal government."
 Bohla_Cyclone.2.d:0 "A stationary cyclone rapidly accelerated north of the Bay of Bengal and made landfall in East Pakistan by that evening, near Chittagong. The Pakistan Meteorological Department did issue an alert, but many locals were not sure what it entailed. 144 km/h winds, with a storm tide peaking at 4 meters. The impact was devastating. Local authorities report entire villages and island populations were annihilated by the storm. In the areas hit by the storm locals report nearly ninety percent of structures were destroyed. Millions are affected and casualties are said to number the hundreds of thousands. The government claims to be providing as much support as possible but media outlets and locals are criticizing the response. The estimated damage is immense and international aid is being prepared." 


 COMPAK_Kashmir.1.d:0 "Flush with Soviet arms and imbued with confidence by his Soviet advisors, General Akbar Khan has presented the Party with an ultimatum. The General noted the officers like him who supported the coup did so out of a belief that action was needed in Kashmir before India grew too powerful. Now Akbar Khan has declared the time is ripe for action to resolve Kashmir successfully. The senior Party leadership read this demand for action and believe the country is not ready for such action as the revolution continue. However, they do believe there are two options. One is to give Akbar Khan the greenlight to initiate a border skirmish with India, this should sate the appetite of the military for a time. The other option is to remove Akbar Khan and replace him with someone more cool-headed like General Musa Khan"
 COMPAK_Kashmir.2.d:0 "The recent conflict ended in victory for our forces. Due to the revolutionary fervor and skill of our forces we triumphed over our enemy. They lack proper motivation to resist our forces. The nation was galvanized by our success and those who participated in the operations are being extensively praised in the media. The military high command is now doubt feeling very good with the results and will be satisfied for the time being. The political leadership is also happy with the outcome as they are using it as justification for why the revolution was necessary. The limited scope of the operation was enough to satisfy our objectives and not enough of an escalation to push the Indians to expand their operations. With this success we will continue to build our military and prepare for a future final resolution to our dispute with the Indians. The India media is downplaying recent events as a minor border skirmish with not clear result."
 COMPAK_Kashmir.3.d:0 "Despite the gallant and brave efforts of our armed forces on the border, the recent fighting did not go as we had hoped. The enemy proved much tougher than anticipated. Our media is portraying the battles as a heroic effort with successes, though within the military the truth is widely known and morale took a blow at this setback. Some officers are even rumbling that the recent purges and new direction were the cause of the failed performance. Those officers we identified will be dealt with. Despite the failure, the results have cooled some of the more hawkish leaders within the military. It will greatly strengthen the hands of our party and political leadership. We can concentrate on transforming the country and building up the capabilities and revolutionary fervor of our military. When the time comes, we will strike the blow that will not only liberate the people of Kashmir but all workers in India."

 Bangladesh_Independence.1.d:0 "News of Ayub Khan assuming the Presidency has sent massive crowds surging across East Pakistan, especially in Dacca. The people of East Pakistan have long felt neglected by the center and this newest development appears to have confirmed their suspicion that the coup was a plot by the West Pakistani dominated military to seize the country for itself, especially since it had now removed Iskandar Mirza, a Bengali. Surging crowds in Dacca marched largely unchallenged as local police appeared unwilling to intervene. The small number of soldiers from the 14th Division guarding the East Pakistan Assembly were forced to fight their way to the cantonment area, resulting in heavy civilian and military casualties. The cantonment is now under a virtual siege and the locally raised East Pakistan Rifles battalions across East Pakistan are defecting to the people in droves. Virtually all their West Pakistani compatriots are now under armed guard." 
 Bangladesh_Independence.2.d:0 "Since independence the Pakistani government has maintained a small garrison in East Pakistan consisting of the 14th Division. This force is based from the Dacca cantonment but is currently under siege by rioting Bengali protestors opposed to the coup launched by the military. In West Pakistan, the military has calculated its options are limited as an airlift of reinforcements is not feasible. The rebels in Dacca seized the East Pakistan Assembly and are proclaiming their succession from Pakistan, claiming the independence of Bangladesh. The only other forces are locally raised East Pakistan Rifles who have largely defected and have taken their West Pakistani colleagues as prisoners. The rebel forces stated they will allow all Pakistani military personnel to leave the country, if the government promises not to engage in armed conflict. The commander of the 14th notes his forces are desperately short of equipment but will fight if ordered by the government, despite their families being with them in the cantonment."  
 Bangladesh_Independence.3.d:0 "The Pakistan government announced that it would not risk the lives of its soldiers on a hopeless display or risk the loss of innocent civilians who would be caught in the crossfire. President Ayub Khan noted that an airlift was already underway, with aircraft from several friendly states arriving to Dacca to help the transportation of the 14th Division, West Pakistani military personnel with the East Pakistan Rifles, and loyal government employees back to West Pakistan. He stated the government views Bangladesh as a rebellious territory but states it will seek talks in the future to eventually reunite the country. Many in West Pakistan are happy to see the violence end and the troops return, but there is a deep sense of anger brewing. Many argue an independent Bangladesh threatens the basis of the existence of Pakistan and many on the left note this dramatic transformation would not have occurred had the military stayed in its barracks."
 Bangladesh_Independence.4.d:0 "The Pakistan government ordered the 14th Division to hold out till the end for the honor of their country and then rejected the demands from the so-called Bangladeshi government. Within hours rebel fighters, bolstered by the arrival of defecting Pakistani units, engaged in street to street fighting around the cantonment. The Pakistani forces held on for several days before running out of ammunition and were soon overwhelmed. Both sides took heavy military casualties but also civilian casualties as residential areas became battlegrounds. In the chaos the families of military personnel living in the cantonments also took losses due to the fighting and its aftermath. The surviving military personnel and the military families are being held in detention. The Bangladeshi government passed a resolution honoring the heroic sacrifices of their people against the Pakistani state and noted Pakistan send thousands into combat for no reasonable purpose. Internationally the Pakistani action is being strongly condemned but domestically, the people are rallying behind the government and their martyrs."

 PAK_ECON.1.d:0 "At independence Pakistan inherited one of the largest jute producing regions of the world in East Pakistan and major cotton producing areas in West Pakistan. The government has development funds and must decide on whether to use those funds to build cotton processing facilities in West Pakistan or jute processing facilities in East Pakistan. Some officials note such an investment will help make Pakistani cotton more competitive on the global market. While others argue that the jute industry has great potential, but partition left many of their processing facilities in Indian Bengal. Putting these facilities in East Pakistan will help restore the jute industry and allow it to thrive."
 PAK_ECON.2.d:0 "One of the pressing issues facing Pakistan at independence was the lack of banks and finance available to the new nation. The establishment of the National Bank of Pakistan has helped alleviate the commercial banking demand. It opened its first branch in East Pakistan to help the jute industry. Now the bank is looking to expand and open new branches. One group of officials believe the bank should open up more locations in Karachi the rapidly growing capital of the country. Others argue that the success in East Pakistan should be expanded and more branches will lead to more growth for the province." 
 PAK_ECON.4.d:0 "The colonial British had long neglected the North West Frontier Province NWFP due to its difficult conditions and role in the Anglo-Afghan Wars. The federal budget has some extra surplus cash that can be spent on improving roads in the province. However, an alternative option is available in East Pakistan, where in the interior there is also a shortage of roads and infrastructure improvements. While what is today East Pakistan did provide extensive raw materials during the colonial period, much of the infrastructure investment went to what is now Indian Bengal. Using that surplus to improve the infrastructure in East Pakistan maybe more useful than investing in the NWFP."
 PAK_ECON.3.d:0 "The Finance Minister informs us that two growing corporations are interested in receiving extensive credit from the national bank to support an expansion into the steel manufacturing market. One is the Lahore based Mughal Traders company. They originally were iron and steel importers but want to establish their own production facilities. The other company which has applied for an expansion is BSRM. This company already has a small steel mill but with to expand and modernize their equipment to ramp up production. Both companies have sound proposals but we can only afford to support the expansion of one."	
 PAK_ECON.5.d:0 "Since independence, both Karachi and Chittagong have risen in prominence. Both are vital ports for the country. In addition, both have seen an influx in refugees trying to find a new life in Pakistan. The cabinet has recently received development funding requests from the two cities. Both would like to expand their ports and incentivize industrial development to offer employment for newly arrived residents. As our country is still growing and does not come from immense wealth, it is up to the cabinet to decide who receives this development. Supporters for Chittagong argue it deserves more development as Dacca reaps the most resources. Karachi backers note that since the city is the federal capital, the government should support efforts to make it more developed and appealing to not just the people but international visitors as well."	

 INDIA_PAK_COM.1.d:0 "The Communist Party of Pakistan CPP formed months after independence during the 2nd All-India Conference of the Communist Party of India. Over the next few weeks, in Dacca, the ruling CPP will host its first All-India Party Conference with representatives from the Indian Communist Party. The two parties have already announced they will work closely together and renew their shared history. However, the conference will also discuss three major issues. One is whether Pakistan should begin the process of being a base for the export of revolution into India or its neighbors. The second is whether Pakistan will open its borders and allow Indian communist activists and workers to come and help the country. Finally, the question of nationalism and Bengal will also be decided."	
 Bengal_Question.1.d:0 "The Bengali delegates of both the Indian Communist Party and the Communist Party of Pakistan CPP sit together and often vote together throughout the conference. This powerful voting block has brought to the discussion the idea of respecting national sovereignty and argue the revolution can be more effectively implemented if East Pakistan is allowed total autonomy. A Socialist Republic of Bangladesh would be able to directly mobilize workers and peasants as they are more advanced in their class consciousness than in West Pakistan. Finally, they could also help speak to and mobilize the Indian Bengali working class. The CPP leadership has carefully considered this proposal and there is a lot of support for the proposal. However, there are many who fear that dividing the country will alienate the reactionary and anti-revolutionary classes in Pakistan who will try to exploit such a move as a sign of weakness. This will be the last topic for the conference to decide on."	

 Ayub_Khan.1.d:0 "General Ayub Khan, the Chief Martial Law Administrator announced that Iskander Mirza and resigned from office and had transferred his powers to him. The General announced he would take the title of President, promote himself to Field Marshal and step down as the Army Chief. The new Army Chief will be General Muhammad Musa. President Ayub Khan promised that the military intervention will last only until the nation has a system of government which will act in the interest of all citizens and not be vulnerable to the corruption and dirty politics of the last decade. Many in Pakistan are applauding the new President as they saw Mirza as a part of the old political class. His resignation and flight to London is being seen by observers as evidence that Ayub Khan has won the struggle for leadership in Pakistan."
 Ayub_Khan.2.d:0 "President Ayub Khan in recent weeks has been holding meetings with senior bureaucrats, civil service officers, and judicial officials. He noted that since independence it has been them and the military who have kept the Pakistani state functioning as politicians constantly wrangled and worked to overthrow one another, leading to inefficiency in political leadership. The President called on these groups to work with him and ensure the Pakistani people have more effective government and that the administration of the country is not negatively impacted by the Martial Law regime. He noted the military has little knowledge on governance and their support will be vital. These senior officials were very receptive to the President and it appears a nexus of a military-civil service alliance is being formed to run the country." 
 
 Gilgit.1.d:0 "The government of Pakistan confirmed it had taken over direct administration over Gilgit-Balistan and the Azad Kashmiri government agreed to hand over administration. The reason for this is that Gilgit-Balistan is that the more populous Gilgit region is not directly linked to Azad Kashmir. More importantly, during the Kashmir War it was the Gilgit Scouts, led by Major William Brown, and the people of the area who liberated themselves from the Kashmiri government, they pledged their loyalty not to a new independent Kashmir but to Pakistan. The Indian government has condemned this announcement and claim we are annexing Gilgit-Balistan from historical Kashmir to ensure in a future peace deal we do not risk losing those lands. Our government has dismissed the Indian suggestion as ludicrous." 
 USA_PAK.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Pakistan recently concluded an extensive state visit to the United States. The high-power trip saw the Prime Minister arrive with senior cabinet ministers. During the trip the ministers met with their counterparts while the Prime Minister held extensive talks with the President. The Prime Minister also addressed Congress, informing them of the aspirations and early struggles of Pakistan. He toured major landmarks and at the Pentagon he emphasized his desire to see Pakistan armed to deal with any threat, especially communism. The visit ended with a glamourous state dinner and before the Prime Minister left, he invited the American President to visit Pakistan soon. The American media was quite impressed with the Prime Minister while the media in Pakistan noted, with pride, the impressive protocol afforded their leader. The American President promised to help address the agricultural shortages facing Pakistan." 
 
 Rawalpindi.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister recently learned of a plot against the government involving military officers and senior leftists by the Army Chief. The information comes from one of the alleged plotters who reported he had attended a party in which he saw prominent leftists present with at least one senior general. He stated they made statements disparaging the current leadership for not mobilizing the population and invading Kashmir as soon as possible. The officer added he believed they were discussing how positive it would be for the Army to establish a new, leftist government, but stated he did not hear any concrete planning. The Army Chief has asked the Prime Minister if he would like to act and arrest the conspirators or leave them be. Although arresting the conspirators would root out the threat, some advisors suggest the information received is scant and making the arrests may end up making the government look weak and embarrass the military." 
 Rawalpindi.2.d:0 "The nation was stunned today as newspapers published a press release from the Prime Minister in which he revealed the arrest of fifteen military officers and prominent leftist activists, including members of the Communist Party of Pakistan over a plot to overthrow the government. The statement noted that General Akbar Khan sought to violently overthrow the government and install a communist regime in order to launch a campaign of internal repression and war. The arrested officers include several colonels and majors while famed poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz was among the leftists arrested. All the conspirators will be swiftly tried and brought to justice. Many in Pakistan applaud the swift action by the Prime Minister to sweep up this Rawalpindi Conspiracy. However, critics note the lack of evidence presented in the statement and some are suggesting the Army itself may not be trustworthy." 
 Rawalpindi.3.d:0 "Highly organized communist cadres in Dacca and Karachi simultaneously stormed government buildings this morning. They took many politicians and officials hostage and when the Prime Minister called the military headquarters to demand action. However, upon calling he discovered most senior commanders were being detained and communist sympathizing senior officers had taken over GHQ. With GHQ under their control, the coup leaders ordered local military units not to intervene against the communist cadres and soon the government had capitulated to the coup led by General Akbar Khan. Over the previous years, a conspiracy involving military officers and leading leftists saw sympathetic officers be shifted to strategic positions and the mobilization of communist cadres to act at the right moment. General Akbar Khan has so far minimized the possibility of a counter-coup by detaining the senior generals and by his reputation as the famed commander of freedom fighters during the Kashmir War." 
 Rawalpindi.4.d:0 "The recent coup saw an alliance of leftist activists, disgruntled military officers, and the Communist Party of Pakistan CPP act in coordination to seize power. In a recent party meeting, the CPP has announced the appointment of famed poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz as the new leader of Pakistan. He has a strong following and leftist credentials due to his poetry while his background as a former military officer makes him acceptable to many of the leftist officers. He will coordinate efforts by the party to unite the factions and begin the process of transforming Pakistan and ending inequality. General Akbar Khan, who led the military officers and Sajjad Zaheer, the former head of the CPP both recognize they lack the national appeal of Faiz Ahmed Faiz but are expected to rule closely with him and were given senior positions."

 PAK_ASSASIN.2.d:0 "In a stunning tragedy, beloved Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan was gunned down in Rawalpindi today. He was addressing citizens at a park when the gunman struck. Police officers immediately returned fire, killing the assassin. The assassin was identified as Said Khan, an Afghan national. The government are investigating his motives, but it appears this was the act of a disturbed individual and not a conspiracy, though many in the country suspect an Afghan plot. The nation is already said to be in mourning with messages of sympathy arriving from neighboring sates and leading politicians in both Pakistan and India. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan leaves behind a wife and three children."
 PAK_ASSASIN.1.d:0 "The assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan has plunged Pakistan into mourning but also a palpable sense of uncertainty. Prime Minister Ali Khan had guided Pakistan through the difficult early years of independence, and he was seen as the only leader capable of guiding the Constituent Assembly on its difficult mission to create a constitution. For the Muslim League, the loss of Liaquat Ali Khan has led to renewed fears the party may collapse. Ali Khan masterfully kept the many groups attached to the party unified and it remains to be seen if the party will endure without him. The Prime Minister post now needs a new leader and members of the Constituent Assembly are struggling to come up with a leader who has national legitimacy. Many are calling on the Governor General to stepdown and take over as no one in the assembly appears capable. To the people of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan has become the Shaheed-e-Millat, Martyr of the Nation."

 PAK_Constitution.0.d:0 "Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan commissioned Khawaja Nazimuddin to establish a committee to determine the underlying principles that would determine the future constitution. The report was recently released. The report argued only Urdu would be the national language and proposed a legislature that split the seats evenly with West and East Pakistan. It also called on creating a ulema council to study all laws and confirm they conformed to Islam. The report has seen a huge backlash in the press, especially from minorities and Bengalis in East Pakistan. Minorities find the ulema council to be problematic. Bengalis have criticized the language provision and equal seats, noting that equaling the representation of both wings was undemocratic and ignored the fact that East Pakistan had a larger population. Upon hearing this backlash, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan asked the committee to reconvene and resubmit the form later." 
 PAK_Constitution.1.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The government declared an end to all colonial era laws and regulations which had been governing the country as it worked on making the constitution. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. It would be a parliamentary system with only one house, called the National Assembly. East and West Pakistan will each have an equal number of representatives. The President will be ceremonial but possess emergency powers if needed and the national languages will be Urdu, English, and Bengali. The government is being praised for its efforts as it worked closely with the opposition to pass finalize the document. Governor-General Iskandar Mirza will become President. Although the constitution is being well-received there are some concerns over the Presidential emergency powers and the provisions giving the Center a free reign to interfere in provincial government matters."
 PAK_Constitution.2.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ending the last visages of colonialism. It would be a parliamentary system, with two houses. Although the seats will be divided proportionally to population, giving East Pakistan more seats, the constitution has provisions for reserved seats which when added together creates parity. The constitution is very similar to the Bogra formula and emphasizes the importance of an independent judiciary. The country will have three national languages, Bengali, Urdu, and English and provincial rights are guaranteed by the parliament. However, the President, though largely ceremonial does have certain emergency powers to remove provincial and federal governments. It is believed this was added to ensure the Governor-General and future President Iskandar Mirza approved the document."
 PAK_Constitution.3.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Nation of Pakistan. The new constitution envisions a two-house parliament, one made up exclusively of Muslim men of character. The other consisting of ulema from across the country. The constitution defined Muslims as those who believe the finality of the prophet and declared the Sharia Court to be the highest court in the country. The head of state will be the Sadar-e-Mumlikat meaning head of state and this office will be held by the current Governor-General, Iskandar Mirza. In the future, this position will be elected by the two houses form among its members. This position also possesses emergency powers, which some suggest was the cost demanded by Mirza before he approved the constitution. The reaction among the elites, minorities, and those connected to the government has been pure horror over the new constitution." 

 PAEC.1.d:0 "The government confirmed the establishment of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission PAEC. This is the culmination to the decision by Pakistan to engage in the Atoms for Peace program of the United States. The independent body brings together the leading nuclear and physics scientists of Pakistan origin who will work to develop nuclear energy as a solution to the growing demand for energy. The first chairman will be the highly respected experimental physicist Dr. Nazir Ahmed. The PAEC announced it has no intentions of engaging in weapons research and hopes to utilize this new technology for the benefit of the Pakistani people. The United States notes Pakistan has shown a keen interest in this energy technology form the beginning and looks forward to helping the country achieve its energy needs. Scholarships and funding for young Pakistani scientists will be distributed by the PAEC to build the knowledge base necessary for a peaceful nuclear program." 
 PAK_INDIA.10.d:0 "The Indian government recently offered a no war pact with our government. This was meant to embarrass us internationally and try to portray Pakistan as a nation itching for war. In response to their offer, our government gave a press conference and noted that Pakistan would love nothing more than to have peaceful relations with India and dreams of both nations working side by side for the security of South Asia. However, India is well aware that we cannot agree to such a treaty as long as the festering wound of Kashmir remains. If the Indian government implements the UN resolutions and works to resolve the issue in a way that recognizes the wishes of Kashmiris, then certainly a no war pact would be reasonable. But given the present circumstances, such a pact is impossible to seriously consider." 
 Afghan_PAK.20.d:0 "Since the independence of Pakistan, Afghanistan has constantly challenged us internationally. Afghanistan voted against our entrance to the United Nations are said to be trying to stir up tribal uprisings against our government. This dates back to the British period when Afghanistan claimed the Pathans residing in our lands belong to them. Now the Afghans claim their treaties with the British no longer apply and they have claim to our western territories with Pathan populations. Considering the tensions with India, many in the government feel continued conflict with Afghanistan only hurts us. However, others suggest having a hardline, tough approach to the Afghans will ensure they do not try and stab us in the back. We control their access to international goods, we can threaten them about it." 
 Gwadar.1.d:0 "The port of Gwadar has long been under the administration of the Omani Sultan. His claim to the port were secured by agreements with the British and the neighboring Princely State of Makran, who previously controlled the port. After Pakistan gained independence, Makran joined the country but Gwadar remained under Omani rule. Recently, the Pakistani government approached the Omani government and after friendly negotiations, the Omanis have agreed to return Gwadar to Pakistan under a sale of purchase. The agreement shows how Muslim brothers can work together to work in the interests of the people and is a contrast to the Indians who often utilize brute force when dealing with land claims. With Gwadar secure, West Pakistan now has a second deep water port it can develop in the future." 
 Khan_PAK.1.d:0 "The Pakistani Foreign Minister, Zafarullah Khan has proven to be an amazing asset for our government. Since independence he has not only eloquently defended our government, but he helped push key UN resolutions over Kashmir that demanded their right of self-determination be preserved. In those early debates on Kashmir he constantly outmaneuvered his Indian opponents and made sure no power vetoed the resolutions passed. He also played a major role in aiding UN discussions during the Palestine Partition and has strengthened our ties with the United States by openly condemning communist aggression internationally. He remains a thorn to the Indian propaganda effort over Kashmir and is viewed as a great spokesman for Kashmir at home and an esteemed statesman abroad." 

 Lahore_Riots.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin has received an ultimatum from an alliance of ulema called the Majlis-i-Amal. The ultimatum calls for the removal of Ahmadis from government offices and the declaration that Ahmadis are non-Muslim. The conflict is over the belief by many mainstream Muslim communities that the Ahmadis, who claim to be a Muslim sect, are not Muslims as they do not believe in the finality of the prophet. Although the Prime Minister is a conservative with a strong religious belief, he is a strict constitutionalist and has rejected the ultimatum. Unfortunately, this decision has led to riots erupting in Lahore where supporters of the Majlis-i-Amal are ransacking, looting, and destroying the homes, businesses, and houses of worship of the Ahmadis living there. The police are said to be joining the rioters and now the Prime Minister must call martial law and deploy the troops." 
 Lahore_Riots.2.d:0 "The anti-Ahmadi riots which engulfed the city weeks earlier has largely come to an end. After the Prime Minister deployed the Pakistan Army to restore order and implement martial law, the citizens of the country were excited by how quickly the Army succeeded. Within hours of entering the city, violence began to decline as troops strictly imposed curfew. Unlike the police, military discipline held, and none joined the protestors. Martial law remains in place but life in the city is returning to normal. The main imams involved in the protests were sentenced to death by military courts, though many suspect the sentences will be commuted to life terms. The people of Lahore report friendly interactions with the Army. A beautification program launched by the Army has some residents joking the military is leaving Lahore nicer than before the riots. Some in Pakistan now wonder if the boys in khaki offer more stability than the politicians in Karachi." 
 PAK_1955.1.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has reconvened after its dismissal by the Governor-General. The new assembly consists of three factions, the Triple Alliance, which combines the divided conservative faction that has governed the country since partition. The United Front also has supporters in the assembly, they consist of leftists, many from East Pakistan who were recently galvanized over the language debate. They also benefit from the perception that East Pakistanis are being undermined by the establishment. Finally, there is the Jamaat-i-Islami, the main Islamist party in the country. The Jamaat continues to struggle politically due to its opposition over the creation of Pakistan but still has an impressive network of grassroots networks across the country. The Governor-General must decide whether to keep the Triple Alliance in power, go with the popular but dangerous United Front, or let the Jamaat-i-Islami take power." 
 Ahmedi.1.d:0 "The parliament recently passed a new bill which it claimed solves the Ahmadi Question permanently. The bill declares Ahmadis to be non-Muslim as they do not meet the constitutional requirements of what a Muslim is and releases all those convicted of involvement in the recent Lahore Riots. The bill notes those Muslims who participated were driven by passion and a desire to protect the faith and cannot be punished for doing the will of God. The bill bans Ahmadis from being buried in Muslim cemeteries or from calling their houses of worship mosques. News of the bill has already seen many Ahmadi businesses shutdown and houses go for sale. Western embassies are being bombarded with applications for asylum and one of the largest business communities in Lahore appears to be leaving the country in droves." 
 PAK_REl.1.d:0 "The Jamaat-i-Islami government announced it would expand the number of imams on bases and within military units. In addition, it noted the Chaplain Corps will be renamed the Imam Corps as they expect to announce the removal of non-Muslims from the armed forces in the next few years. The increase in imams is meant to improve the morale of the fighting men and the imams will have a higher rank than previously. They will also observe and ensure rules of the faith are being observed. Although the military did not respond to this announcement, many believe the military is furious at this intervention into its structure and discipline. Many officers note their forces are already motivated by patriotism and religious fervor to defend the country and the government clearly does not trust them."

 PAK_Afghan_Relations.1.d:0 "Afghanistan has always threatened the unity of our nation. Since independence they constantly stir up Pathan nationalism through their Pashtunistan campaign. In addition, they have continuously refused to recognize our border along the Durand Line. Over the years we suspect they have not only been spreading propaganda but also engaged in clandestine and overt efforts to stir an armed uprising. So far our forces have remained vigilant to the threat. However, the status quo is no longer acceptable, especially as we have other security concerns to deal with. We have two options on Afghanistan. We can either open a dialogue and strengthen bilateral relations, or we can respond to Afghan aggression with our own hardline and force them to the peace table."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.2.d:0 "The Pakistani government has invited us for talks in Peshawar. From media reports and discussions with their ambassadors, it is clear the Pakistanis are seeking to hold an olive branch to us. Although there are some hardliners who advocate we reject the talks as long as Pashtunistan is not on the agenda, doing so will likely alienate non-Pushtoon leaders in the country. They are increasingly criticizing our government for what it calls an obsession with Pashtunistan which has cost the nation dearly in terms of trade. We will send a delegation but the highest-ranking member of it will be the Foreign Minister, this way we can keep both the hardliners and moderates happy. The hardliners will like the idea of not sending more senior officials, while the moderates welcome the possibility of peace talks. The talks will take place in a week."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.3.d:0 "The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan arrived in Peshawar to hold talks with senior Pakistani leaders over the outstanding issues between both states. The Pakistani government gave the visiting Afghans a large reception and provided tours for the first few days, including a tour of the famed Bala Hissar Fort. This visit did result in a small gaffe as the Afghan media criticized the Foreign Minister for visiting the former royal residence of the Afghan monarchy that is now headquarters to what Afghanistan terms an occupying military force. Despite these minor issues, the talks have now started and the Pakistani government has not hidden its hopes that a breakthrough can be reached."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.4.d:0 "The Pakistani government noted that it considers the Durand Line to be the official border of both nations, despite the criticism of Afghanistan. However, it also noted that at independence, Pakistan made it a point to withdraw permanent military outposts from the Tribal Areas to respect the autonomy of its tribes. The Pakistanis state this demonstrates their desire for peace in the region and respect for the peoples living on the border. In fact the Pakistanis have offered to further loosen border restrictions on the border to allow Afghan and Pakistani families separated at the border to more easily travel to one another. On the surface the proposal appears very sound and would benefit Afghani families. Signing the agreement appears very beneficial, especially if we want peace eventually. However, some in Kabul worry the proposal is a steppingstone for the Pakistanis to lull Afghanistan and eventually have us accept the Durand Line."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.5.d:0 "The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan informed the Pakistani government that the proposal on looser borders was unacceptable. The Minister insists the only solution to the crisis is the removal of Pakistani forces from Pashtunistan and a referendum for the people to decide. With no progress in sight, the talks were quickly concluded. Many in Pakistan are disappointed over the failed talks, with some opposition leaders openly criticizing the President for his failure in resolving tensions with Afghanistan. Regardless, the government feels it had to try and hopes in time the Afghan government can see reason. In Kabul the hardliners praised the government for its firm stance, while moderates voiced criticism over the inflexibility shown during the negotiations."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.6.d:0 "In Peshawar, representatives of the Pakistani and Afghan government signed an agreement to loosen border restrictions in order to facilitate travel between families that are separated by the border. For Afghanistan, the agreement will provide relief to many of its citizens who have bitterly criticized border restrictions for years. In Pakistan, the agreement is seen as an act of political maturity from the government and an indication of its desire to have peaceful relations with Afghanistan. However, there are some critics to the agreement. Hardliners in Kabul accuse the government of betraying the sacred pledge for Pashtunistan while in Pakistan some have expressed concern that more open borders could lead to Afghan infiltration in the country. Regardless, the majority of people in both nations appear satisfied with the agreement."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.100.d:0 "Following our successful agreement with Afghanistan on looser borders, relations are positive and we are in a good position diplomatically. Some officials believe now is the time to offer a referendum on Pashtunistan for the people of the Tribal Areas, not the North-West Frontier Province or areas of Baluchistan. Although the Afghans argue the referendum should be done by a neutral party, we can simply say that as no military outposts are present in the Tribal Areas, there can be no fear of intimidation. We will even offer to sign a binding agreement with Afghanistan to respect the results. At the very least Afghanistan will appreciate the gesture, and if they accept, we are confident the Tribal Areas will remain in Pakistan."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.7.d:0 "In an extraordinary proposal, the Pakistani government has offered to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan. However, there are some caveats, they have limited only to the Tribal Areas and will administer the referendum themselves. This proposal shows at the very least a desire from the Pakistanis to listen and can be appreciated. Indeed, moderates and some hardliners within the government urge us to accept the proposal. If the Tribal Areas vote to join Afghanistan, it very well may lead to public pressure in Pakistan to expand the referendum to the NWFP and Baluchistan. Many hardliners and some moderates however, disagree. They see the offer as disengenous and a ploy to try and weaken our position on the issue. They insist Pakistan would not accept the vote unless they knew they could win. Instead they argue we should at the very least accept the gesture in good faith, but decline as it does not cover all of Pashtunistan."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.8.d:0 "Kabul informed our Foreign Minister they have accepted the offer to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan in the Tribal Areas. We have already sent out an announcement on the vote which will take place in about 90 days. The reaction in Afghanistan is mixed, with some calling it the first step to liberation while others arguing it is a Pakistani ploy. Preparations are already beginning as we dispatched instructions to Political Agents in the Tribal Areas to mobilize support among tribal leaders. In addition, intelligence resources are also being sent in to monitor how people plan to vote and ensure the pro-Pakistani numbers increase."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.9.d:0 "The Afghan government informed us they did not approve of the proposal to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan in the Tribal Areas. Afghanistan would want such a vote to incorporate all of Pashtunistan and ideally be conducted through a neutral third party. Regardless, Afghanistan did mention they appreciated the gesture as a positive movement and hoped we would soon accept the need for a comprehensive referendum in the future. Although our proposal was rejected, we did improve relations as our offer caused further divisions within the hardliner faction in Kabul, which only strengthens the position of those pushing for peace."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.10.d:0 "The long-awaited results from a recent referendum in the Pakistan Tribal Areas on whether its people wished to join Afghanistan as part of Pashtunistan or remain in Pakistan arrived yesterday. The people voted to stay in Pakistan. The Pakistan government praised the tribal people for their dedication and devotion to the nation. The result comes amid accusations that Pakistani officials offered incentives for tribal leaders to endorse voting for Pakistan and reports that residents who travelled between Pakistan and Afghanistan were considered ineligible to vote. Perhaps the biggest criticism was the arrival of many ballots from Pathans in the armed forces who claimed to be from the Tribal Areas. Pakistan is satisfied with the vote and its government claims it had never doubted the loyalty of its people. The reaction from Afghanistan will likely come soon."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.11.d:0 "Kabul released a blistering statement condemning the recent referendum held in the Pakistan Tribal Areas over if the residents wished to remain in Pakistan or join Afghanistan for Pashtunistan. A large majority voted to remain in Pakistan. However, the Afghan government contends widespread voter manipulation occurred in the weeks leading up to the vote. In addition the Pakistanis refused to count the votes of those who regularly traveled across the border, claiming it was unknown if they were permanent residents of the Pakistani Tribal Areas. With these issues, the Afghan government insists the results were illegitimate and they would not stop championing the cause of Pashtunistan for the millions of Pathans struggling under Pakistani occupation."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.12.d:0 "The Pakistan government, in an unusually scathing statement, denounced the government of Afghanistan for its constant interference in Pakistani affairs. They accuse the Afghans of seeking to start armed uprisings and spreading false claims in order to poison the relationship of Pakistan to its citizens along the border. The government noted it had its own capabilities and if the Afghans did not relent, Pakistan would soon have to bring them in line to teach them a lesson. It is clear that Pakistan is nearing a breaking point with Afghanistan."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.13.d:0 "Continuing its recent shift towards hostility, the Pakistan government demanded Afghanistan recognize the Durand Line as the official border between both nations. The Pakistanis insisted Afghans stop living in a fanciful world and accept the reality on the ground. It noted Afghanistan accepted the border under the Raj and as Pakistan inherited those lands, it had to respect the border. This is an aggressive push by Pakistan and some fear they maybe looking at military options. Some in the government suggest we privately assure the Pakistanis we harbor no ambitions for their territory, but that we cannot publicly recognize the border at this moment. The hardliners in the government insist we denounce the Pakistani government for its bullying and reiterate our stance."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.14.d:0 "The Afghan government dispatched an intermediary to inform our government that Afghanistan has heard our warnings. The intermediary insisted Afghanistan currently has no plots or desires to change the status quo along the border. They have also promised to tone down some of the Pashtunistan propaganda and will endeavor to keep relations as cordial as possible. In exchange they have asked us to reign in the hostile commentary and keep channels open. Our government will accept this statement and soon tone down the rhetoric, we have achieved our objective of using a strong posture to push the Afghans towards peace."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.15.d:0 "The Afghan government defiantly condemned our recent statements and reiterated their claims to Pashtunistan. The Afghan government insists it is on a pure and noble mission and they will not be browbeaten by any foreign power. It appears our hardline approach has not led the Afghans to realize their constant hostility benefits no one. Indeed, relations have only worsened, and we must remain vigilant on the western border. The Pakistan Army however, has a proposal on how to firmly show Afghanistan the seriousness of our position and save the situation to our favor."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Border_War:0 "Start Border War with Afghanistan"
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Border_War_desc.d:0 "The Afghan government continues to bring up Pashtunistan and threatens the stability of Pakistan. A bold plan from GHQ calls for our forces to engage in a border conflict with the Afghans. Once we defeat the Afghan forces on the border, their government will realize the gravity of the situation and come to their senses."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.16.d:0 "The recent border war between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended in a victory for Pakistani forces. Pakistani forces recently launched operations against Afghan forces on the border. Many analysts thought the Pakistanis would have the upper hand in the conflict and they were proved right. News of the military defeat on the border led to panic in Kabul as some feared the Pakistani forces may push deeper into the country. However, the Pakistani government instead halted, claiming its forces had delivered a befitting reply to years of Afghan harassment. Sources in Kabul indicate the Pakistanis managed to extract a promise of non-aggression from the Afghan government for at least five years. The Pakistan Army is enjoying public demonstrations in its honor across major Pakistani cities in appreciation for its successful operations."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.17.d:0 "The recent border war between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended in victory for the Afghan Army. Pakistani forces had started the fighting after launching attacks on Afghan troops on the border. Many analysts thought the Pakistanis would have the upper hand, but this proved a faulty assumption. The details are not clear, but it appears the Pakistan military had either underestimated the Afghans or overestimated themselves. Afghan forces not only drove back the Pakistanis but are currently occupying some territory over the border, calling it liberated land of Pashtunistan. With warnings from Delhi, the Pakistan government is incapable of expanding the conflict and must live with the stinging consequences of this failed campaign. In Kabul there is a feeling of joy and optimism that the dream of Pashtunistan is far from a fantasy."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.1.d:0 "The Pakistani Ambassador delivered a message from President Ayub Khan inviting a delegation to hold talks in Pakistan. The message was friendly and it appears the Pakistanis are looking to mend ties. However, we cannot let them lull us into a position where we abandon our brothers across the border. Some of the advisors suggest we reject the invitation as words cannot solve our problems. However, others argue we should accept the invitation, to at least see their stance and maybe improve conditions on the border to our advantage."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.2.d:0 "Our efforts at reaching out to Afghanistan bore fruit as they have agreed to send a high-level delegation to hold talks with us. We can expect their arrival shortly and must consider the approach we wish to take for the talks. For President Ayub, an ethnic Pathan, he is keenly interested in stabilizing ties with Afghanistan and prevent unrest among the Pakistani Pathan population. If such a scenario occurred it could prove disastrous, especially with regards to ties with India. We can take a conciliatory approach and sign agreements to boost ties and cultural exchanges. Or we can take a hardline and call for Afghanistan to accept the Durand Line as the permanent border."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.3.d:0 "During talks held with the Pakistanis, they have offered a series of measures, including cultural exchanges that are meant to improve ties. The Pakistani offer is no doubt meant to normalize ties between our states. Increasing cultural ties would afford us to gain more intelligence and would reduce some of the tension in Kabul. However, accepting the initiative may confuse our own people and reduce their fervor for the Pashtunistan cause. We must decide what move would be best."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.4.d:0 "In a jarring meeting with the Pakistanis, they have stated their desire for us to accept the Durand Line as the permanent border. As this stands against the key pillar of our foreign policy, our delegation immediately refused. It appeared the talks were about to end abruptly, however, the Pakistanis offered a compromise. They stated if we could give private assurances that we can accept the Durand Line that would be enough for them. We can accept this compromise, or reject it outright and end the talks."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.5.d:0 "President Ayub received news that the Afghan government has rebuffed our invitation to hold talks. This is a troubling developments and indicates they are bent on trying to change the status quo. The Afghans are no doubt harboring dangerous designs and we must remain vigilant on the border. Regardless, the military insists the Afghan threat is minimal and can be easily monitored or contained. President Ayub will have to accept this effort has failed."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.6.d:0 "The Afghans proved very receptive to our proposals on normalizing ties and have accepted. They only asked for minor adjustments meant to improve travel for Afghans with relatives in Pakistan. President Ayub enthusiastically signed the agreements and released a statement celebrating what he termed the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Afghan government released its own, more muted statement approving of the agreement, stating it will help facilitate the reunion of Afghans with their families across the border."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.7.d:0 "The Afghan delegation stated they could not in good conscious accept our generous proposals for normalizing ties. They insisted as long as we continued to deny Pathans the right for Pashtunistan, they could not attempt to mend ties. We informed them that there was nothing left to discuss then. The talks thus concluded and the Afghans returned to Kabul. We released a statement expressing our disappointment with the failure to achieve a breakthrough. The Afghans released their own statement accusing us of using the talks as a means to gain a propaganda victory. President Ayub is bitterly disappointed with the outcome."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.8.d:0 "The Afghan delegation reiterated that the Durand Line was not on the table. They added that there did not appear to be anything left to discuss and abruptly ended the talks to return home. For President Ayub Khan this marks a major setback in his efforts to establish a calm western border. The Pakistani government released a statement regretting the talks could not achieve a meaningful breakthrough. The Afghan government released its own terse statement accusing Pakistan of using the talks as means to permanently deny the right of Pashtunistan to the Pathan people.
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.9.d:0 "The Afghan delegation returned and stated that they were willing to give private assurances regarding the Durand Line. They stated they will for the near future not bring up the Durand Line or make it into a major sticking point. President Ayub is very satisfied with this development. The Afghan delegation soon returned back to Kabul. The Pakistani government released a statement calling the talks a positive step and would hopefully lead to a future of positive ties. The Afghan government released its own statement saying it was satisfied with the results of the talks."


 PAK_Dissolve_One_Unit_desc:0 "The One Unit created an artificial and large government structure. It also erased the individual identities of our diverse population. The policy proved unpopular, especially for government employees who were being stationed in areas far from their homes. The original four provinces of West Pakistan are now restored."
 PAK_Expand_Provincial_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "The previous regime overly centralized power to the President and federal services. This over centralization slowed development and effective governance on the local level. With the provinces restored, provincial civil servants will be appointed in much larger numbers."
 PAK_Reduce_Federal_Authority_desc:0 "The government announced a new initiative that curtails federal involvement or reach into the provincial affairs of the provinces. The people of Pakistan must trust their local authorities and operate without fear of any federal interventions."
 PAK_Launch_Anti_Pashtunistan_Campaign_desc:0 "The Afghan government has advocated for the formation of Pashtunistan for decades. They use the cause to raise unrest among our own Pathan population and to rally popular support in Afghanistan. Working with local officials, an anti-Pashtunistan campaign will be launched. We will use the news media and radio broadcasts to battle the Afghan propaganda."
 PAK_Afghan_Indian_Relations_desc:0 "President Fatima Jinnah heavily criticized Ayub Khan for being too soft with India. She also agreed to allow the military to take the lead on regional issues. She plans to challenge India diplomatically and allow the military to take a hardline with Afghanistan."
 PAK_Denounce_Indian_Stubborness_desc:0 "In a press conference with the international press, President Fatima Jinnah condemned the Indian government for their refusal to engage in a meaningful dialogue. She insisted India remains the only impediment to peace for South Asia."
 PAK_Military_Insists_On_Hardline_desc:0 "The Pakistan military reports the regional security situation remains highly tense. The Indians continue to increase their troop presence on the border. Afghanistan remains a potent threat. Its government continues to enflame its population with its ridiculous call for Pashtunistan. Pakistan must prepare for the worst."
 PAK_Express_Solidarity_With_Kashmir_At_UN_desc:0 "The Pakistan government initiated a major diplomatic campaign at the United Nations. They are arguing the Kashmiri people remain victims of Indian political games. The effort has found support among sympathetic powers, and the Pakistan permanent representative noted that just raising awareness is a major victory."
 PAK_New_Afghan_Border_Posts_desc:0 "The Pakistan Army announced the establishment of new border posts and the deployment of more paramilitary forces patrolling the area. The trans-frontier tribes, which regularly move back and forth from the border will be heavily restricted by this move. The Afghan government heavily criticized the action."
 PAK_Adopt_Universal_Suffrage_desc:0 "After a brief debate, the National Assembly passed several constitutional amendments establishing universal suffrage. The previous indirect election system through basic democrats has been abolished. The new amendments are being widely praised as many Pakistanis welcome a return to democratic rights."
 PAK_Transform_To_Parliamentary_System_desc:0 "The National Assembly finally passed a series of amendments turning Pakistan into a parliamentary system. President Fatima Jinnah welcomed the news, calling it a return to the historical norm. This is a unifying success for the ruling coalition."

 PAK_1965_Election.1.d:0 "The government announced Presidential elections will be held in three months, they outlined there would be one month of campaigning for the candidates. The 80,000 basic democrats will act as an electoral college for the indirect election, selecting the candidate. Nine projection meetings are to be held where each candidate can lay out their vision for Pakistan to the electors directly. These meetings will not be open for the public or media. President Ayub Khan is almost guaranteed to be the candidate for the Convention Muslim League, a pro-Ayub faction of the Pakistan Muslim League Party. Opposition leaders are condemning the short campaign season along with the indirect elections. They claim everything favors President Ayub Khan. A spokesman for the government denies this, claiming these elections represent a new era of democracy for Pakistan."
 PAK_1965_Election.2.d:0 "The major opposition parties announced their nomination of Fatima Jinnah for the Presidency. The five parties have formed a coalition called the Combined Opposition Party in order to pool resources to dethrone the Ayub Khan regime. Fatima Jinnah, sister of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the late founder of Pakistan, is widely popular among the people, affectionately known as the Mother of the Nation. The new coalition released a nine point program. Among its goals is to restore parliamentary democracy and universal suffrage, to dismantle the current indirect election system. Fatima Jinnah released a statement calling on the Pakistan people to unite for democracy and end the dictatorship of Ayub Khan."
 PAK_1965_Election.3.d:0 "Fatima Jinnah, the beloved sister of the venerated founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah is campaigning across Pakistan for the Presidency. She is the candidate for the Combined Opposition Party and is opposing the sitting President, Ayub Khan. Newspapers are publishing pictures and reporting on massive crowds coming out to see Jinnah. In her speeches Jinnah condemns the Ayub Khan regime for being too soft on India, secular, and anti-democratic. She wishes to restore democracy, end the current indirect election system, and more openly incorporate Islam to the state. As she remained largely out of the public eye since the early 1950s, many Pakistanis are coming to see her campaign and travel, many hoping to just have a glimpse of a woman seen as a great freedom fighter for independence and known across the nation as Mader-e Millat (mother of the nation)."
 PAK_1965_Election.4.d:0 "Over the past several weeks, a number of President Ayub Khan supporters and members of the media have published scathing articles and editorials against Fatima Jinnah. In addition, local authorities have allowed very conservative parties to hold demonstrations condemning the notion of a woman leader for Pakistan. This despite the fact that Jinnah has the endorsement of the largest religious party, the Jamaat-i-Islami. However, this campaign to discredit Jinnah has backfired. Intellectuals, politicians, and activists across the country have rallied to her support. Crowds of Pakistanis are also condemning the government for offending the reputation of a woman widely considered to be the Mader-e Millat (mother of the nation). The backlash is directly impacting the popularity of Ayub Khan."
 PAK_1965_Election.5.d:0 "The election season has kicked off with four candidates competing for the 80,000 basic democrat voters. This is the first major indirect franchise election in Pakistan history. The incumbent, President Ayub Khan is the heavy favorite, having established the current election system. The five major opposition parties organized under a coalition called the Combined Opposition Party and nominated the widely popular Fatima Jinnah. The other two candidates are from obscure backgrounds and not expected to play a major role. President Ayub Khan is expected to campaign on a platform of continuing his economic reforms and restoration of political stability. Fatima Jinnah will campaign on a platform calling for the restoration of a parliamentary system and a universal franchise for future elections."
 PAK_1965_Election.6.d:0 "Fatima Jinnah recently concluded a campaign tour of major cities in East and West Pakistan. At each stop she was met with massive, highly enthusiastic crowds. The crowds in East Pakistan were especially enthusiastic for the woman called the Mother of the Nation. She also condemned Ayub Khan for a weak stance with regards to India and supporting the Kashmiri people. Pro-Ayub activists spread disparaging comments regarding Fatima Jinnah, but these efforts at smearing her name largely alienated Pakistanis who still widely respect the sister of the beloved Mohammad Ali Jinnah. President Ayub Khan has focused his campaigning on rural areas, where his reforms have seen the most success. As most of the 80,000 basic democrats come from these areas, many believe this is a sound strategy. Despite the show of popular support, Ayub Khan is still expected to win."
 PAK_1965_Election.7.d:0 "A senior civil servant has privately approached Fatima Jinnah, asking her to visit a secret meeting of senior military and government officials. These officials come from a variety of backgrounds. Some hold her with reverence due to her closeness with Mohammad Ali Jinnah and her role in founding the nation. Others pragmatically note she is the more popular candidate but lacks support from the basic democrats. If Jinnah accepts, she may see an opportunity at overcoming the current election system. However, to do so she may have to make major compromises. She must decide whether to attend or not."
 PAK_1965_Election.8.d:0 "Under utmost security, senior government and military officials, many represented by trusted allies, met with Fatima Jinnah. In the meeting, she insisted her commitment to restoring parliamentary democracy and ending the indirect election system. She also noted Ayub Khan was holding the nation back and showing weakness to India. The officials present expressed support to her stance but stated they would only support her if she agreed to several demands. They stated she should refrain from calling Ayub Khan a dictator and allow him a peaceful retirement if she wins. They also demanded she maintain the current economic reforms or interfere in military affairs. The agreement would need to kept secret. Fatima Jinnah must decide what to do."
 PAK_1965_Election.9.d:0 "State media confirmed that Fatima Jinnah has won the 1965 Pakistan Presidential Elections. She won a majority of the popular vote, but more importantly, she won a slim majority of the 80,000 basic democrats who elect the President. Many analysts believe that despite the popularity of Jinnah, she would not be able to secure the electoral college which consists of mostly rural representatives with close ties to the incumbent, President Ayub Khan. Miss Jinnah released a statement thanking the basic democrats for supporting the wishes of the people. Millions are celebrating across cities in Pakistan, with the largest crowds in Dacca. Fatima Jinnah, the popular sister of the Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah is widely respected. President Ayub Khan, who ceased power in a coup, did not release any statement over the results."
 PAK_1965_Election.10.d:0 "President Ayub Khan announced he accepts the election result and will retire from public life once the new government takes over. He pledged his loyalty to the nation and claimed his hope the people will recognize his devotion to them. Fatima Jinnah, the president elect, praised Ayub Khan for accepting the results. When asked if Ayub Khan and his political allies would be charged or investigated for corruption, she dismissed the notion. Her conciliatory comments were a major stepdown from some of her earlier, harsh criticisms of Ayub Khan. Despite his brave face, sources say Ayub Khan is stunned by the election results. The senior military leadership informed their former chief that they would back the new government, leaving him little choice but to retire."
 PAK_1965_Election.11.d:0 "The 1965 Presidential Elections occurred. The people of Pakistan are to elect 80,000 Basic Democrats who then voted for the president. When the final tally was released, President Ayub Khan was declared the winner, receiving over sixty percent of the vote. His victory was seen as a forgone conclusion as most the Basic Democrats were his appointees. However, analysts were still surprised by how many votes Fatima Jinnah ended up receiving. The reaction among many Pakistanis is disappointment as many felt she had the support of the people. Many in the country now view the constitution setup by Ayub Khan as rigged to keep him in power and there are now calls for more democratic reforms, especially from East Pakistan where Fatima Jinnah was especially popular."
 
 Jinnah_President.1.d:0 "The Pakistan government released a statement encouraging provinces to select cultural holidays relevant to local communities. This is a step back from the past where the federal government sought to impose a more unified, national identity at the expense of ethnic traditions or historical figures. The East Pakistan government welcomed the news, promising to hold holidays for great Bengali literary heroes. The NWFP released its own statement, calling for a Pashto language week to champion the great poets of the frontier. The move is part of an effort to find balance between the federal government and the provinces."
 Jinnah_President.2.d:0 "President Fatima Jinnah has called an extraordinary session of the National Assembly. In her address, she called on its members to work diligently to reform the constitution. She called for a balanced democracy that provided stability and gave power to the people. Jinnah is leading a coalition of different parties. Despite their varying ideologies, the coalition is united in their vision to undo the Ayub Khan democracy. Jinnah has deftly kept these parties together through her abilities and status as the sister of the late Pakistani founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah."
 Jinnah_President.3.d:0 "In the final session of the extraordinary National Assembly session, a series of amendments were passed that reduced Presidential powers. Under President Ayub Khan, he had given the President extensive powers. President Fatima Jinnah had long pushed for the reforms. She believed Pakistan had long been plagued by an overly powerful executive branch. Under the reforms, the President still retains powers, but no longer can act with complete impunity. The decision is being welcomed across all political circles. For the first time, it now appears Pakistan has balanced its political institutions."
 Jinnah_President.4.d:0 "After a long cabinet meeting, President Fatima Jinnah announced a boycott of Indian goods. She stated though the decision reflected the feelings of the people. If the Indian government continues its hostility towards Pakistan, there is no reason to engage them with trade. The President campaigned on maintaining a hardline towards the Indian government. The Pakistan military is said to be thrilled with the decision. The embargo is being widely supported by most circles in the country. However, some critics point out the decision only hurts the economy. Internationally, many states expressed concern over the escalation of tensions."
 Jinnah_President.5.d:0 "President Fatima Jinnah ended a recent session of the National Assembly. Since taking over the presidency, she has reversed the presidential power and restored a parliamentary system of government. Learning from previous mistakes, she has sought to reduce presidential powers to create a balanced executive branch. Despite her reforms and amendments to the constitution, her coalition looks increasingly fractured. Many political pundits believe it is only her personality and prestige that keeps the present government in power. Regardless, she has achieved her vision and all Pakistanis can now enjoy full voting privileges for upcoming elections."
 Jinnah_President.6.d:0 "The nation was stunned to learn President Fatima Jinnah passed away overnight from heart failure. Although rushed to the hospital, she was pronounced dead on arrival. During her brief tenure, she transformed Pakistan, amending the constitution to provide universal suffrage and a more balanced parliamentary democracy. New elections are expected to be announced soon. The ruling coalition brought together a myriad of parties with vastly different ideologies, the reputation of Jinnah and their mission to remove Ayub Khan kept it intact. She will also be remembered as the first woman to govern a Muslim-majority state. A massive state funeral is planned for Karachi. She is expected to be buried next to her brother at the Mazar-e-Quaid."

 PAK_MAAG.1.d:0 "With the completion of the first phase of MAAG, there are many in the military who want to approach the Americans to immediately begin the next phase with new arms to modernize the military. The Army is keen to expand the armoured forces while the Air Force has expressed interest in acquiring more advanced fighters from the United States. The Navy would like to ensure a new, more modern submarine for the fleet. However, approaching the Americans may require us to be more firmly connected to their interests. It may be better to modernize our forces through our own efforts to retain independence."
 PAK_MAAG.2.d:0 "The Pakistanis have requested more military aid to modernize their forces through a new phase of MAAG. The first phase was a success and our officers on the ground did send glowing reports regarding the Pakistan Army. However, there were and remain doubts on whether Pakistan can economically maintain an extensive military. In addition, many are suspicious they primarily want this military equipment not to deter communism but to confront their rival India. India is also very sensitive to our military relationship to Pakistan and a new effort at providing weapons will not be received well. If we do decide to provide the equipment they desire, we must demand Pakistan denounce the Soviet Union and Communist China and provide military bases for us to demonstrate their sincerity. Or we can preserve ties with India and politely decline their request."
 PAK_MAAG.3.d:0 "The Americans have agreed to extend MAAG support for an additional infantry division, armored division, and mechanized brigade, along with artillery. For the Air Force they will provide some more advanced fighters and expand our bombers. The navy would also receive a new submarine. In exchange they have asked us to severely roll back our ties with China and the Soviet Union. They also seek to have bases in our country. Such a deal will provide us much equipment but severely affects our foreign policy and will likely lead to domestic unrest over the agreement. Some ministers are urging that we politely reject the offer and pursue a more independent defence and foreign policy agenda."
 PAK_MAAG.4.d:0 "News of our recent agreement with the United States has seen a large backlash across the country. Leftists, anti-colonial, and religious groups have rallied their supporters to protest across all major cities. The government is being condemned for selling out the country. India has largely denounced the agreement, blaming America for fueling the arms race in South Asia. Despite the loud protests, both the United States and Pakistani government welcomed the agreement as vital to preserving Pakistan and halting communism in the region."
 PAK_MAAG.5.d:0 "The government was informed that the military had taken possession of all weapons and systems promised by the Americans. The military also stated it did not foresee any major issues with its forces operating the weapon systems as American trainers had provided extensive help in that regard. The government noted its satisfaction with the report and lauded the military for its efforts to ensure the nation maintained a strong, robust capable of thwarting any hostile plans or adventures."
 Ayub.1.d:0 "The director of the ISI, the premier intelligence agency of the country met with President Ayub Khan. President Ayub Khan was meeting to discuss the possibility of having intelligence assets mobilized to monitor domestic politics and potential threats to his regime. The current government is essential to saving Pakistan from foreign aggression and the corruption that plagued the early years of the country. The director stated that the agency could certainly aid the government but doing so would compromise their ability to monitor foreign threats. It must be decided if the ISI should sacrifice its foreign intelligence capabilities and work to bolster the regime or stay out of politics all together."
 Ayub.2.d:0 "Soon after taking power, President Ayub Khan appointed the former Chief Justice Shahabuddin to chair a commission to propose a constitutional framework that will avoid the political instability and corruption of the earlier regime. The report came out and proposed a presidential system of government instead of parliamentary. The new system would be bicameral with an upper house meant to check the lower one. The President would enjoy powerful executive powers, especially over the appointment of governors. The commission recommended a return of political parties and all elected officials must pass education requirements. Elections would be based on universal suffrage. President Ayub could accept the report as is to form a democratic constitution but his advisors suggest he propose revisions, that strengthen Presidential powers, preserve his Basic Democrats electoral system, and keep the ban on political parties. Ayub is inclined to offer revisions and establish a more presidential constitution."
 Pak_Econ60s.1.d:0 "As we go through the ambitious Five Year Plan the issue of securing financing has arisen. We will certainly maximize the avenues of raising funds domestically, but we are a young, poor nation and to transform it we need access to higher financing. The United States has expressed a willingness to offer financial aid and facilitate access to international aid from their allies. The government is inclined to maximize such financial aid to truly transform the nation in this critical juncture. However, several ministers have expressed concerns that relying on such funds may leave Pakistan financially vulnerable, and though it may slow the potential growth, pursuing moderate aid maybe the more prudent decision to make. We must decide whether to maximize the American aid or ask for moderate aid to cover some of the gaps in our financing efforts."
 Pak_Econ60s.2.d:0 "The Five Year Plan has been massively successful, in large parts due to our ability to raise financial aid and friendly loans. However, these payments have reached a critical level. The government must now devote a substantial part of the budget to meet these obligations. The economic developments spurred by these funds have not yet reached a level to facilitate the continued growth of the country and its payment commitments. As a result, the economic objectives for the coming years must be readjusted to this stark financial situation."
 Pak_Econ60s.3.d:0 "The Five Year Plan has been massively successful, in large parts due to our ability to raise financial aid and friendly loans. However, these payments have reached a critical level. The government must now devote a substantial part of the budget to meet these obligations. The economic developments spurred by these funds have not yet reached a level to facilitate the continued growth of the country and its payment commitments. Luckily, the commitments are not overwhelming, and the Finance Minister insists that the country will soon resolve the crisis and return to its economic objectives. As a result, the economic objectives for the coming years must be readjusted to this stark financial situation."
 PAK_Land_Reform.1.d:0 "One of the early actions of the Ayub Khan government was to take on the feudal system which long dominated the agricultural sector and caused extreme hardship to the peasants working the land. Reforms were made to limit the maximum amount of land owned by an individual and ensure some basic rights for peasants. Although many believe these reforms possess too many loopholes to be transformative, the new land ownership requirement has seen the government seize millions of acres of unproductive lands. This land can be used to bolster agricultural production and the economy. A senior advisor noted that though the land could be distributed to productive peasant farmers, this land could also be given as retirement grants for junior officers in the military. This would reward their services to the state and strengthen their loyalty to Ayub Khan. The government must decide whether the land should go to peasants or the officers."
 PAK_Land_Reform.2.d:0 "The government announced it was currently handing out parcels of unproductive lands under its stewardship to peasants across Pakistan. The government noted the system of feudal agriculture has long plagued agricultural productivity in Pakistan, but this was being rectified. The government noted its shock at the amount of viable land being unutilized in the country. The press and public have largely welcomed the news from the government. The popular measure will help Ayub Khan endear himself to the population, but the traditional rural elite are said to be seething over the measures, which they see as a humiliation targeting them."
 PAK_Land_Reform.3.d:0 "The government announced it would parcel out the unproductive lands under its stewardship as retirement rewards for officers in the Pakistan Army, Air Force, and Navy. The government noted that as a poor nation, Pakistani officers sacrificed financial and material opportunities in service of the nation. This land would act as a modest but just reward for their service as military men possessed the discipline, and patriotism to ensure such lands would not be wasted as it had previously. The action is being well-received by the government-controlled press and the officer corps. Ayub Khan can certainly count on his officers for the foreseeable future."
 PAK_Financial.1.d:0 "The Planning Committee for the Five Year Plan and the Finance Minister approached President Ayub Khan to discuss options on boosting the flow of cash and private capital. There is a proposal for new legislation on industry that would largely remove financial regulations and practices in order to encourage the expansion of industry and push for maximum growth. Some on the Committee however, caution this deregulation, warning it may lead to more fiscal problems down the line. Instead they believe certain outdated and economically conservative elements can be reformed or removed to encourage a modest growth."
 PAK_Financial.2.d:0 "The government announced an unprecedented relaxation on regulations, especially those related to industry. This new policy is meant to help fuel rapid economic growth for Pakistan and its industrial base. Along with this reform, the government announced plans to pass a series of legislation focused on strengthening and streamlining funding for industrial projects. The Finance Minister called on both international investors and local businesses to take advantage of the friendly business atmosphere in Pakistan. He insisted concerns over worker rights or the long-term effects of these actions are greatly exaggerated and these policies are essential for the prosperity of Pakistan now."
 PAK_Financial.3.d:0 "The Finance Ministry released a statement describing a series of reforms meant to reduce regulations and hinderances for growth in the industry sector of the economy. The statement noted this would not be a free for all and efforts were made to preserve some protections from overspending or organizations over committing. The government later released its own comments and called on all interested parties to take advantage of the friendly business atmosphere and great potential of Pakistan and its people."
 PAK_Financial.4.d:0 "The deregulation policies meant to spur industrial expansion and economic growth have led to corporations falling into deep debts, greatly hindering economic growth. The reduction of protections, especially for workers have also seen an economic decline among those populations, slowing the economy further and hurting efficiency. The decline in government coffers means their ability to spur growth and keep cash flowing has greatly reduced. The Finance Minister announced revised figures for industrial growth and has restored some regulations in order to halt the economic slowdown."
 PAK_Financial.5.d:0 "The deregulation policies meant to spur industrial expansion and economic growth have led to corporations falling into deep debts, hindering economic growth. The reduction of protections, especially for workers have cut their wage earnings and add fuel to the lackluster performance of local industries and businesses. The decline in government coffers means their ability to spur growth and keep cash flowing has greatly reduced. The Finance Minister announced revised figures for industrial growth and has restored some regulations in order to halt the economic slowdown. However, the ministry noted it believed this downturn would be temporary and he expects the economy to recover soon."

 Bengal_Issue_Ayub.1.d:0 "The Bengalis in East Pakistan have long harbored suspicions of being second-class citizens or being overlooked by the federal government. This despite their large population, huge economic role, and historical devotion to the Pakistan Movement. When war initially broke out over Kashmir, rumors spread that West Pakistan had abandoned East Pakistan. Unfortunately, the resulting conflict seemed to confirm this suspicion. The lack of major military formations in the province and a perceived lackluster response by the authorities to establish air raid shelters or warning systems fueled a feeling of abandonment. Our forces and officials acted as effectively as they could, but unfortunately this was not appreciated by the East Pakistani population."
 Bengal_Issue_Ayub.2.d:0 "The Bengalis in East Pakistan have long harbored suspicions of being second-class citizens or being overlooked by the federal government. This despite their large population, huge economic role, and historical devotion to the Pakistan Movement. Many opposed the military takeover by Ayub Khan and this opposition intensified when he unveiled his Basic Democrat system. For many East Pakistanis, Ayub Khan has implemented a system meant to deny East Pakistanis proportional representation and limit their political aspirations. Crowds of Bengalis, especially students, are regularly protesting for democratic governance."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.1.d:0 "Ever since Sheikh Mujibur Rahman released his dangerous Six Points he has caused mass unrest among Bengalis across East Pakistan. The Bengalis are increasingly being attracted to an anti-state path and the status quo does not appear to be a solution right now. The question is how to approach this difficult problem without causing more problems or fueling separatist tendencies among Bengalis. One approach is to discredit Rahman and his Awami League. Our intelligence agencies have discovered a plot involving separatists and the Indian government. Pursuing this case publicly would expose the Awami League as the traitors we know them to be. Many advisors support this approach. The other option is to reduce restrictions on public protests. This would be a concession that allows us to invite the Awami League for high-level talks regarding the future of East Pakistan. We would likely have to compromise but swiftly moving in that direction could reduce the possibility of armed resistance."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.2.d:0 "After a deep investigation, the ISI informed the government of a vast conspiracy it uncovered in East Pakistan. According to their agents, leading members of the Awami League, along with Bengali military officers and civil servants have conspired to organize an armed uprising for a separate state. Many of the key conspirators, including top aids of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were holding these talks in the Indian town of Agartala, often with Indian intelligence and military officials to secure their support for the uprising. Our intelligence agent at one point was fired upon by some conspirators but still managed to bring the information. The government will soon issue arrest warrants and announce the charges against the accused."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.3.d:0 "The nation of Pakistan was stunned this morning over reports that military officers, civil servants, and Awami League members, including party leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were arrested. They are being charged by the government for conspiring with India to launch an insurrection against the state of Pakistan. The government statement suggests the recent efforts by the Awami League to demand more autonomy was only a ploy made under Indian guidance to weaken Pakistan. President Ayub Khan in his own statement called for a swift trial to reveal the truth of this evil conspiracy. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in his statement denied the charges, calling them fabricated and a desperate attempt to silence the voice of the Bengali majority."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.4.d:0 "The long-awaited trial of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his alleged conspirators began today. The court is a tribunal led by three judges, one non-Bengali the other two Bengali. They are to hear evidence that the accused plotted an armed uprising against Pakistan with the help of a foreign power, India. The case will see over 200 witnesses along with evidence to support an extensive charge list. However, there is widespread anger over the case in East Pakistan. Many accuse the government of fabricating the charges in a conspiracy against autonomy for East Pakistan. These claims were fueled by revelations from a British attorney aiding the accused that some of the witnesses admitted to being coerced into testifying. Large protests are occurring daily, calling for the case to be dismissed."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.5.d:0 "The Agartala Conspiracy trial continues to alienate and spur protest among Bengalis in East Pakistan. As the trial continues, more and more Bengalis increasingly view the charges as outlandish and a plot meant to silence the popular Sheikh Mujubur Rahman. In a recent development, students, especially from Dacca University, have started joining the protests. This agitation continues to negatively impact the economy and functioning of the state. The government however remains defiant and claims it will not halt its pursuit of justice. However, it continues to face accusations that witnesses were coerced and documents were falsified."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.6.d:0 "The Bengali protestors agitating for the dismissal of charges against those accused in the Agartala Conspiracy trial have formed an Action Committee. The Action Committee, directed by Awami League activists plans on organizing protests, strikes, and agitation in order to maximize the impact against the government. President Ayub Khan had hoped the case would show the people of East Pakistan the danger of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and expose him as a separatist, however, it appears this effort has backfired. Even pro-democracy activists in West Pakistan are beginning to voice support for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the case is turning into an anti-Ayub cause."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.7.d:0 "Dacca was swept in violence following news that Sergeant Zahurul Haq, one of the accused in the Agartala Conspiracy Case was shot by a guard. Although he was rushed to the local military hospital, Haq succumbed to his wounds. It is unclear what led to the shooting but news of it caused massive mobs to start fires at government buildings and the State House where the case is being heard. The three tribunal judges managed to escape but the resulting attacks saw widespread fires that burned evidence and documents related to the case. The next morning massive crowds returned to Dacca to condemn the killing and accuse the government of trying to assassinate the accused as the court case was stalling."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.8.d:0 "President Ayub Khan directed the government to withdraw the Agartala Conspiracy case and dismiss the charges against the accused. In a statement the government insisted it had the evidence to convict but the circumstances on the ground and instability made the trial unsustainable. After his release from prison, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the other accused went to a massive public reception at a Dacca racecourse. He was met with jubilant crowds who chanted his new title among the people, the Friend of Bengal. In his comments Rahman insisted the Six Points were not separatist nor anti-Pakistan and stated his appreciation for the people who stopped a dictator from erasing the opposition and voice of the people. Many Bengalis view this episode as a great victory, and many in East Pakistan are now firmly in support of the Awami League, making the trial a major blunder from Ayub Khan."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.1.d:0 "Following the decision of the government to lift restrictions on protests, the Awami League and its leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman agreed to hold talks with President Ayub Khan over the Six Points. Mujibur Raham released the Six Points earlier as the basis for relations between East Pakistan and West Pakistan. Critics note the Six Points separates almost all institutions in the country and would leave East Pakistan virtually independent. However, supporters of the Six Points state its implementation would stop tensions between the two wings and allow both to grow together instead of at the expense of each other. The talks are expected to be long and difficult, but many across the country are said to find this recent government initiative a positive step."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.2.d:0 "During the initial phase of discussions, both the government and Awami League laid out their negotiating positions. However, it has become clear that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman appears unwilling to compromise on his hugely popular Six Points and has called on the government to adopt it for East Pakistan. He stated this was the only route to ensure peace and unity for all of Pakistan. The government side is said to be annoyed by this posturing. However, some of the advisors for Ayub Khan suggest he can offer East Pakistan greater autonomy, essentially adopting several of the Six Points but not conceding on granting East Pakistan an independent economy or completely independent defence force. The other option would be to walk out of the talks, this would be seen as popular to West Pakistanis but would effectively fail at resolving the tensions in East Pakistan."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.3.d:0 "President Ayub Khan carefully laid out a proposal to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman over the future status of East Pakistan. He noted his appreciation that many in the province desire major change in the relationship between both wings. However, he stated as is, the Six Points was not a feasible solution. Instead he has offered to grant East Pakistan extensive autonomy, giving it control of its development funds, taxation, and internal policies. However, he could not grant a completely independent economy or an independent defence force. Though he offered concessions on both, including giving control of the East Pakistan Rifles to the East Pakistan legislature. For Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, this would grant him many of the Six Points and achieve his goal of autonomy. He and key supporters are inclined to accept the compromise. However, some hardliners in the party insist they remain committed to the Six Points and reject the proposal."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.4.d:0 "President Ayub Khan abruptly ended the Round Table talks and returned to West Pakistan. He stated his government sought to earnestly discuss outstanding issues with the Awami League but the group proved unwilling to negotiate for the betterment of the people of Pakistan. Many editorials in West Pakistan spoke in favor of the President, stating he had made the right decision and exposed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as a dishonest politician who harbors dangerous designs for the future of Pakistan. In East Pakistan, the Awami League blamed the government for acting rashly and using the talks as a means to score political points with their base. Although they received support from pro-democracy newspapers, they also faced criticism, especially from the other major East Pakistani parties who accused the Awami League of pushing a radical agenda against the will of many Bengalis and Biharis living in East Pakistan."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.5.d:0 "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League told the government he accepted their compromise. He personally told President Ayub Khan that the Bengali people would not forget his decision to listen to their desires. The President reciprocated the kind words and stated his hope that the new agreement would herald a new era for Pakistan. It was decided that a formal agreement would not be signed, and once the President informed the senior government officials, a final agreement could be made. Until then, both sides agreed not to reveal the details or preliminary agreement reached as it could be changed. When the talks ended, both sides released a statement noting great progress had been made and future talks were likely. Analysts noted neither pro-government or pro-Awami League publications sought to criticize the other side and as President Ayub Khan returned to Pakistan, a sense of optimism prevailed."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.6.d:0 "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the leader of the Awami League rejected the proposal by the government to offer much greater autonomy for East Pakistan. President Ayub Khan thought the offer was fair as it met most of the Six Points, but the Awami League still refused. The talks quickly concluded afterwards and both sides released terse statements. The government accused the Awami League of negotiating dishonestly and rejecting reasonable offers. The Awami League stated it would not compromise on the dignity of the people of East Pakistan. Nationally, supporters of the government were satisfied with its actions. Although the Awami League supporters are satisfied, their hardline has alienated those on the fence."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.7.d:0 "In stunning news, the expected agreement between the government and Awami League has fallen through. The Awami League claims the government sought to change the agreed upon terms and it could not accept them. Nationally there is much disappointment at the failure of the government to complete an agreement. President Ayub Khan is quiet over the failure, but analysts suspect the Pakistan military likely spoke against the proposed agreement. Without the support of the military, the government had no choice but to let the agreement fail. With both sides dug in on their stances, there is little hope for the future."
 PAK_1965_Economy.1.d:0 "In response to a series of media reports on corruption within the country, including accusations against family members of President Ayub, the government has published its own reports on corruption. The government identified key leaders in black market training and families which possess excessive amounts of wealth and land. The government has promised to crackdown on these issues to lower the prices of goods and force such families to pay their share of taxes to the state. Many in the public have welcomed this new initiative."
 PAK_1965_Economy.1.d:0 "Since the last war ended, the country faces the dilemma on how it must rebuild. Some advocate the priority should be on rebuilding the national economy. However, considering the continued security situation we face, there are many who advocate a focus on rebuilding our military capacity. Rebuilding the economy could provide us with a long-term base to establish a stronger defence industry. However, neglecting the armed forces now could lead to disaster if India or Afghanistan choose to challenge us. We must determine where to put our limited resources in recovering from the war."
 PAK_1965_Economy.3.d:0 "The economy is currently suffering a downturn, mostly due to the increasing debt incurred by the government and excessive spending by banks. The Finance Minister is worried the current interest rate is too low and we should raise it in order to control the potential of a crisis of payments. Some advisors worry raising interest rates will alienate business interests and hurt growth, but sometimes the government must make the difficult decisions. The choice of how to act lies with the President."
 PAK_1965_Economy.4.d:0 "Many banks across Pakistan are reporting they are running dangerously low on funds and are struggling to recoup the credit they have been extending. A lot of this is due to government encouragement of financing and the current interest rates. The banks will be a lot more reluctant to hand out financing and will need time to rebuild their assets. This is a major blow for the economic health of the country, but we will persevere and prosper."
 PAK_1965_Economy.5.d:0 "The Pakistan government recently sent a delegation of top economic officials to discuss the continuation of financing for its economic programs. The Pakistanis noted that American aid in securing foreign financing had greatly aided the government in its last economic plan. They noted that for Pakistan to finally turn the corner economically, it needs more support. We have to decide if we want to continue supporting the Pakistani economy. This would improve relations and give us more leverage with them. However, there are others who argue too much funding will make Pakistan dependent on such support and hurt their economy in the long-term, we must decide what to do."
 PAK_1965_Economy.6.d:0 "We received excellent news from Washington. The US agreed to continue supporting our economy through economic aid and loans. They will also help us secure funding from other friendly states to keep the economy booming. Although some advisors worry our dependence on such funding will lead to long-term issues, the benefits now can truly transform our nation into a modern economy. The Finance Minister is already drawing up plans to use the funding for major development projects. Ideally with this support, the entire nation will soon reap the benefits of a booming economy."

 SINO_PAK.1.d:0 "Initial relations with China and Pakistan were hindered by geopolitical alignments and border disputes. However, a recent initiative by Pakistan to hold talks on the disputed border were accepted by the Chinese. After weeks of fruitful negotiations, the two sides came to an agreement. The agreement saw both nations commit to demarcate their border. Pakistan also agreed to cede the Karakoram Tract to China. The Chinese and Pakistani government see the agreement as the beginning of a genuine friendship. Although the reaction has been largely positive among the people, the Indian government is strongly criticizing it. Many Indian newspapers argue Pakistan has no right to even cede the lands it did. Regardless, it appears Pakistan and China have turned a corner in their relationship."
 SINO_PAK.2.d:0 "The Pakistan and Chinese government announced both sides had begun constructing a land route which will link the two countries together. The proposed route will connect the NWFP and Punjab to Xinjiang via Gilgit-Baltistan. The two sides agreed the highway will cross from the Khunjerab pass. The Pakistani construction will be done by the Frontier Works Organization which plans on using the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers for the project. The proposed project will be one of the longest, highest all-weather highways on the planet. The Pakistani government notes the project will restore the ancient Silk Road connections and restore the historical contact between the people of Pakistan and China."
 SINO_PAK.3.d:0 "Construction on the Karakoram Highway continues for both Pakistan and China. So far there have been dozens of fatalities due to avalanches and extreme conditions. A Chinese cemetery has been established in Gilgit. However, despite the hardships, the project continues, and Pakistani engineers are learning valuable lessons in road construction and planning. Indian experts have expressed concern that the proposed route, when completed would allow China the ability to send supplies or even troops at any time of the year, regardless of weather conditions. Currently many Himalaya paths and routes are inaccessible for large scale military movements from January to April."
 SINO_PAK.4.d:0 "The Pakistani and Chinese Foreign Ministries released a statement announcing the Karakoram Highway was entering its final phase of construction. It noted that despite extreme dangers, both Pakistani and Chinese workers continue to work diligently and enthusiastically for the betterment of their people. Foreign correspondents have been taken to completed portions of the highway and their reports describe a highly durable roadway. Both governments continue to praise and publicize the difficult engineering feats accomplished and cooperation between both nations. The Frontier Works Organization has used the experiences gained from the project to greatly expand its engineering capabilities."
 SINO_PAK.5.d:0 "In a splendid ceremony the first truck, loaded with goods, left from Kashgar in China. It was received by cheering crowds when it arrived in Abbottabad in Pakistan, marking the official opening of the Karakoram Highway. Later, the Pakistan government hosted a celebratory banquet with their Chinese counterparts and diplomats. The Chinese media praised the opening of what they call the Friendship Highway. In Pakistan, the leading newspapers described the road as the Eighth Wonder of the World. The new highway ensures Pakistan and Chinese land links will be year-round, aiding trade and contact. Strategically, and to the concern of India, the route ensures China could militarily or materially support Pakistan even during the hostile winter season. The Frontier Works Organization is now the premier military engineering organization in Pakistan."

 PRC_PACT.1.d:0 "Only India knows the threat from China firsthand. Although we have our differences with India, it may be necessary to put our mutual hostilities on hold for the near future. Reports on the Chinese borders continue to send alarm bells across the government. Of course, there are still many outstanding issues with India and an attempt to rapidly normalize ties could potentially spark unrest. However, several senior officials suggest we can offer India either a three year or five-year non-aggression pact. This would allow both nations the opportunity to work on shoring up weaknesses in regard to China. Some military leaders suggest the whole initiative is foolish and Pakistan must deal with China on its own. The cabinet must now decide to propose one of the non-aggression options or the cabinet could decide to just scrap the proposed initiative."
 PRC_PACT.2.d:0 "The Foreign Minister received his Pakistani counterpart who offered an unprecedented proposal. He offered to sign a three-year non-aggression pact with our government that will guarantee no chance of conflict during the length of the agreement. The Pakistanis are currently concerned with their border with China. They fear the Chinese plan to take lands they occupy the same way they recently did to ours. The three-year period would allow their government and our own to better prepare our territories from future Chinese aggression and may offer the first steps towards wider peace. However, some military leaders expressed concerns the proposal is a ploy to facilitate a future Pakistani offensive at a time of their convenience. The cabinet must decide how to respond."

 PRC_PACT.4.d:0 "In a surprising development, the Pakistani and Indian government announced a new three-year agreement pledging mutual non-aggression called the Indo-Pakistan Non-Aggression Pact. The two traditional South Asian rivals were motivated into this agreement over fears of an increasingly assertive Chinese foreign policy. Analysts believe the agreement will allow both states to focus more on better preparing their position along the Chinese border and solidify their domestic base without the threat of a wider South Asian war. The Chinese condemned the agreement as a conspiracy while Western states welcomed the move. Domestically, the reaction has been muted though in Pakistan there were some protests against the government cooperating with India."

 PRC_PACT.6.d:0 "The unprecedented Indo-Pakistan Non-Aggression Pact has formally expired. Pakistan proposed the agreement out of concern over China. India, which also has outstanding border issues with China, welcomed the agreement as an opportunity to build up its own capabilities to deal with the Chinese threat. The agreement did see a small flourishing of ties and cultural exchange between India and Pakistan. However, with the agreement now expired, there are fears that a new arms race between India and Pakistan may escalate. Despite the successful agreement, progress in other issues would be necessary to see Pakistan and India transform their ties from one of rivalry to friendship."
 PRC_PACT.7.d:0 "The Foreign Minister returned from India with disappointing news. The Indian government refused to sign our proposed non-aggression pact. They cited security concerns and noted they were a peace-loving nation uninterested in warmongering. However, it is clear that India remains a potent threat to our national security. As the situation with China continues to develop, our forces and intelligence must remain vigilant to the nefarious plans of the enemy. Adding insult to injury the Indian government leaked the proposal in a way that made our government look weak. The Chinese are said to be upset over what they called a proposed anti-Chinese alliance."
 
 PAK_SEC.1.d:0 "The United States has watched our struggles with China closely and their officials on the ground have expressed sympathies to the communist threat north of us. We can dispatch a high-powered diplomatic mission to the United States to ask for security support. America can be a strong bulwark against communist aggression. However, some cabinet members worry about our increased dependency on America and fear such a mission could be seen as a sign of weakness by a population inherently hostile to perceived imperial powers."
 PAK_SEC.2.d:0 "A high-level Pakistani military and diplomatic mission has spent the last few days visiting the Pentagon, Congress, and White House in an effort to shore up support for their nation. The Pakistanis are fearful of communist Chinese aggression on its borders and are asking for help in collecting equipment for up to three new mountain divisions. The State Department and Pentagon have provided three options for how we can respond to the Pakistanis. One is to provide equipment for the raising of three mountain divisions, which will infuriate India. The second is to provide non-lethal aid and mountain warfare training support, this would reduce Indian anger and not humiliate the Pakistanis. Finally, we can simply decline to provide any aid, which will likely hurt relations with Pakistan but they are quite dependent on our support so such a diplomatic setback would be temporary."
 PAK_SEC.3.d:0 "In response to our request for help to deal with the China threat, the United States has agreed to provide equipment for us to eventually raise three mountain divisions. As we have told the United States since we gained independence, as long as they provide the tools, we can best train, equip, and deploy our men. The governments of China and India have both bitterly criticized the American decision, but this is of no concern as the security of Pakistan is far more vital of a concern. Editorials across the country are portraying the military aid as the result of a pragmatic government policy to marshal friends."
 PAK_SEC.4.d:0 "In response to our request for help to deal with the China threat, the United States announced it would provide nonlethal aid and advanced mountain warfare training to us. Though this is a disappointing result, as many in the Army hoped American equipment could help it raise new formations, it will still provide valuable support to Pakistan. The government welcomed the American decision but privately were disappointed. Some editorials noted the aid was far less than requested and suggest the United States limited its aid to reduce Indian anxiety over the matter. The Chinese government expressed concern over the increasing presence of the United States to the region. American military experts are expected to soon arrive and modernize the mountain warfare training facilities in Pakistan."
 
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.1.d:0 "A Holy Relic was stolen from the famed Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar. The relic is believed by locals to be strand of hair of the Prophet, originally seized in the seventeenth century by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. When news spread of the theft, tens of thousands took to the street to protest in Kashmir. The Indian and local government are investigating the matter, but the protests are being noted for their size and many observers see this spontaneous agitation as a sign of Kashmiri political agitation over their international status. The Pakistani government has a moral obligation to the people of Kashmir and a decision must be made. Should Pakistan pursue a military option to decisively liberate Kashmir or should it instead focus on diplomatic and intelligence efforts to force India into accepting the UN resolutions on the issue?"
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.2.d:0 "The Pakistani government is giving voice to miscreants and agitators in their occupied Kashmir. They have upgraded the transmission feed for their so-called Radio Free Kashmir. Their broadcasts encourage communalism, spread false propaganda, and agitate for protests. We have already protested to the Pakistani diplomatic mission who claim the radio network is a product of independent Kashmiri activists. Clearly this is an effort by the Pakistani government to spread unrest among the people of Kashmir."
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.3.d:0 "The so-called Radio Free Kashmir recently expanded its transmission feed and broadcasting power to reach more parts of Kashmir. Their broadcasts have long spread Pakistani propaganda and false information, but recently the broadcasts are now encouraging armed resistance. Kashmiris are being called to fight back against our government through any means necessary and also to sabotage government projects in the region. Once again, our calls to the Pakistan government to halt such rhetoric is being ignored, but military commanders on the ground are confident they can control the Kashmiri unrest. Our officials and agents on the ground will track any locals involved in spreading Pakistani propaganda. The broadcasts are being fueled by rumors of political changes for Kashmir within the constitution."
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.4.d:0 "We have successfully identified a number of Kashmiris acting as agents to the Pakistani state. We know they are providing information, often false, for the so-called Radio Free Kashmir to broadcast. These broadcasts are driving a wedge with our relationship to Kashmir and efforts to curtail its broadcasts have not worked. Some senior police and military officials advise we swiftly detain these agents and try them under the sedition laws. Making an example of them will show our government to be strong and send a message. Others in the cabinet instead suggest we simply monitor these individuals and privately approach them and use either conciliatory or coercive methods to convince them to halt their activities. We must decide how to handle this situation."
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.5.d:0 "Across Pakistan, tens of thousands took to the streets to condemn the Indian occupation of Kashmir. Flags of Azad Kashmir flew with Pakistani flags as speakers spent the day condemning the atrocities and oppression in Indian occupied Kashmir. Government officials and ministers joined in many of these protests, pledging the continued devotion of Pakistan to the liberation of Kashmir and its people. The Foreign Ministry released statements across its diplomatic mission highlighting the violence and unrest in occupied Kashmir. This massive public display is meant to shore up government support on the issue and raise international awareness on the disputed territory."
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.6.d:0 "With the public behind us and the people of Indian occupied Kashmir clamoring for a resolution, the moment is right to approach the United Nations in regard to India implementing the UN resolutions related to Kashmir. India is of course a large nation and seemingly committed to its occupation. However, we have drafted a resolution demanding India comply with the resolution or face economic sanctions. The recent unrest in Kashmir and our public efforts have raised awareness internationally. If the United States and Soviet Union do not veto the resolution, we can put immense economic pressure on India until they comply. However, the Foreign Minister suggests that before approaching the United Nations, we should ask first ask India if they would like to hold comprehensive talks, if this effort fails, then we may go to the UN."

 CML_Bhutto.1.d:0 "Considering the situation Pakistan finds itself, the military found it had no choice but to hand power over to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto controls the largest political party in Pakistan and has had electoral success which gives him a legitimacy no military leader possesses. Bhutto in his opening speech promised to rebuild Pakistan both physically and as a people. He has promised to listen to all voices in the country and begin the process of transitioning the country towards a constitution all Pakistanis can approve of. He added his current title of Chief Martial Law Administrator and President were only temporary and meant to aid in the initial rebuilding of the country. His speech was well-received and many see it as a good sign for the future of Pakistan."

 DemRahman65.1.d:0 "The government passed legislation that nationalized the steel industry. This is the latest measures by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to push the nation towards a socialist economy. The nationalization is meant to increase productivity, curtail corruption, and end any exploitation of workers. Rahman told reporters after the vote that the era of crony capitalism in Pakistan was over. He further stated that government guidance and funding would expand productivity and lead to a more efficient industry. Critics point out the government may not have the capability or experience to run such an industry and there are worries that corruption could undermine the process. Regardless, the announcement is expected to be popular among many in the country."
 DemRahman65.2.d:0 "During a recent National Assembly debate, members of the government asked the Foreign Minister questions regarding tie with the United States. These parliamentarians question how Pakistan could maintain friendly ties with a nation openly engaged with colonial powers and at times perpetuating continued colonial rule across the globe. The Foreign Minister agreed with those statements and insisted the government would re-evaluate ties between Pakistan and the United States. Many observers noted this display in parliament was likely staged by the government to showcase why Pakistan wanted to move away from the United States and establish closer ties to socialist states. The American Ambassador noted his disappointment with the comments made at the National Assembly while the State Department in Washington abruptly cancelled a planned visit of senior economic officials to Pakistan. Pakistan likewise cancelled plans to welcome an American military mission to the country. The Chinese and Soviet government are said to be happy with these recent events."

 Yahya_Khan.1.d:0 "President Ayub Khan announced he could no longer preside over a nation in turmoil. He stated his goal had always been the progress and advancement of the people of Pakistan but this was no longer possible. Instead, he has handed power over to General Yahya Khan, his protégé. Khan quickly proclaimed Martial Law and named himself Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). He announced the deployment of troops across the country to restore law and order. Once that was achieved, new, democratic elections will be helped. The general reaction has been cautious optimism. Many in the country wish to see the restoration of democracy but were growing weary of the increasing rise in crime."
 Yahya_Khan.2.d:0 "To better coordinate the security situation in Pakistan and prepare for elections, CMLA Yahya Khan convened a National Security Council (NSC), meant to bring together the top civilian and military security officials. The move is being welcomed by observers who see this as an attempt by the military government to govern with civilians, giving them a broader perspective on the situation facing the country. During the first meeting the NSC lauded the successful restoration of law and order across Pakistan and stated its support for plans to organize new elections for the country as soon as possible."
 Yahya_Khan.3.d:0 "The CMLA General Yahya Khan announced the promulgation of Legal Framework Order no. 1970. This order establishes the framework for the upcoming elections and officially de-establishes the One Unit scheme, restoring the original four provinces of what was Wests Pakistan. The move is being welcomed by many who saw the One Unit scheme as skewing development to the Punjabi majority in West Pakistan and leaving the other regions and ethnic groups behind. In terms of the election, the order promises universal suffrage, proportional representation, giving the eastern wing a majority of seats, and only a simple majority required to amend the constitution. It stipulated that the elected National Assembly will have four months to finalize a new constitution for Pakistan. "

 DemRahman1970.0.d:0 "Once again millions of Pakistanis took to the polls for elections to determine which party would rule Pakistan and who will be President. Former President and father of the current constitution, Ayub Khan announced his retirement from politics and will not participate. However, the young Zulfikar Ali Bhutto appears to be leading his own party, the Pakistan Peoples Party and a centrist coalition against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his leftist coalition of socialist parties. Although Bhutto and Rahman both advocate socialism, Bhutto advocates for an Islamic Socialism which Rahman supporters dismiss as too watered down. For parties at the center and right leaning, Bhutto appears the lesser of two evils, especially as he supports a strong center, however, there is also a ground-swell of support for not just the socialism of Rahman but also his advocacy of an almost non-existent center and greater provincial autonomy, especially for East Pakistan."
 DemRahman1970.1.d:0 "In a tense National Assembly session, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman spoke in favor of a newly presented bill calling for the implementation of the Six Points for East Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman unveiled the Six Points several years earlier as a series of policies meant to secure the rights and dignity of East Pakistan. At the time, West Pakistanis and federalists condemned the proposals for essentially granting East Pakistan independence. After his speech, a fiery debate took place with many in the opposition, especially representatives from West Pakistan, condemned the new bill as writing the death warrant for united Pakistan. Many government representatives and Bengali members spoke in favor of the bill, calling it a restoration of Bengali honor."
 DemRahman1970.2.d:0 "News of the Six Points bill in the National Assembly has seen Pakistan plunged into unrest. Across West Pakistan, many have taken to the street to condemn Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as a Bengali agent working to destroy the nation. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the leader of the opposition spoke at some of the rallies in Karachi, stating he understood the feeling of anguish among the people. In Dacca, Bengalis came in massive crowds celebrating the bill. Many feel Pakistan had treated them as second-class citizens and the new bill would rectify the problem."
 DemRahman1970.3.d:0 "The political fallout of the Six Points bill reached a critical point when all the West Pakistani representatives walked out of the National Assembly and flew out of Dacca. They were led out by the opposition leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Upon landing in Karachi, Bhutto declared they would not return to the parliament unless the government withdrew the Six Points bill. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was defiant, stating he would not be cowed from carrying out the will of the people. He noted the remaining members of the assembly can finish passing the bill without the opposition. Analysts note that without the boycotting parliamentarians, the country appears clearly divided."
 DemRahman1970.4.d:0 "Since the new constitution came into effect, the military accelerated its efforts to better recruit proportional to the ethnic makeup of the country. As a result, there are far more Bengalis in the armed forces than previously. This has made the current political climate more difficult. There had been discussions within the Army to perhaps intervene and seize control over the situation. However, it became clear that such an act might instigate major mutiny or an insurrection by Bengali forces. Considering many of these soldiers and officers are based in East Pakistan, any order to seize the National Assembly could result in disaster. The GHQ informed the opposition leaders that the military cannot act positively given the circumstances."
 DemRahman1970.5.d:0 "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and a delegation of West Pakistani parliamentarians, military leaders, and civil servants met with their Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his own delegation. After a series of discussions, the two sides agreed on a division of assets and the repatriation of West Pakistani personnel from East Pakistan. It is clear Rahman will not compromise on his Six Points and such a passage would be intolerable to the people of West Pakistan. This private agreement paves the way for Rahman to declare Bengali independence and end the united Pakistan experiment. The repatriation is already quietly occurring to make the transition as smooth as possible."
 DemRahman1970.6.d:0 "In a stunning announcement, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has proclaimed the independence of East Pakistan as Bangladesh. He gave the announcement to cheering crowds. Bengalis across the new nation have started to fly homemade flags. In West Pakistan, now just Pakistan, the mood is despondent but muted. Many had expected this announcement for weeks and at this point many feel it is good riddance. Not many Pakistanis remain in the former East Pakistan and they are expected home soon. The Pakistan military has instituted martial law and handed power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the head of the largest political party in the country. He has promised to restore order and establish a new constitution for Pakistan."
 DemRahman1970.7.d:0 "The loss of Bangladesh is a major blow to the Pakistan military. Nearly one-third of its personnel were Bengali and the vast majority have joined the new state. The military will need to rebuild its ranks, but thankfully there are not only ample reserves but a strong tradition of military service among many communities in Pakistan. Regardless, it will take time to restore our capacities and re-establish certain facilities. The new Chief Martial Law Administrator, Zulifkar Ali Bhutto has pledged his complete support for the efforts to restore the Pakistan military to its former glory."
 DemRahman1970.8.d:0 "When President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman supported a proposed bill to adopt the Six Points for East Pakistan it led to intense criticism from West Pakistanis. However, after the initial tension, the two sides agreed to amend the proposed bill in a way that both sides find beneficial. Ultimately, these discussions bore fruit and the government will soon present an amended version of the bill that will pass. Neither side is said to be wholly satisfied with the agreement, but considering the circumstances, it is better than the alternative."
 DemRahman1970.9.d:0 "The newly amended bill on the Six Points past the National Assembly with little debate. The bill revamps the political structure of Pakistan. West Pakistan will become Pakistan and have a separate federal parliament than from the planned establishment of an autonomous East Pakistan. East Pakistan will enjoy its own parliament, defence force, and development policy. The two wings will now be connected through a shared foreign policy and economic ties. Both wings will have their own executives, with disputes resolved through dialogue. The initial reaction of the people in both wings is disappointment, but an acceptance that this solution was needed to stop the decades of political problems plaguing the country since independence."
 DemRahman1970.10.d:0 "Since the announcement regarding the establishment of East Pakistan was announced, federal employees and military personnel were asked to pick which federal system they wanted to join. Either Pakistan or East Pakistan. Since then, there has been extensive effort for the moving of Pakistanis from East Pakistan ahead of the establishment of East Pakistan. At the same time East Pakistanis are also being shifted back home. One newspaper noted a flight of East Pakistani military officers exited a plane in Dacca, only to see Pakistani officers immediately board the same plane to return back to Pakistan. Unfortunately the repatriation is leading to some issues, especially for families where one spouse is from Pakistan and the other from East Pakistan."
 DemRahman1970.11.d:0 "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who will take control of Pakistan once East Pakistan is established concluded talks with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who will head East Pakistan. The two men agreed to a division of national assets between the two sides. This includes the division of cash reserves, resources, and the military. Both men were positive after the talks and expressed their satisfaction over the new Pakistan about to form. The agreement was financially generous to East Pakistan and many interpret this as a gesture from Pakistan that despite the changed status, they still see East Pakistan as a part of united Pakistan."
 DemRahman1970.12.d:0 "After months of negotiations and preparations, East Pakistan finally began functioning as an autonomous province of Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed the people of East Pakistan stating his promise for the restoration of Bengali dignity and honor was complete. He stated Pakistan has emerged stronger and more united with this decision and both wings will now prosper together and not at the expense of each other. Large crowds gathered to watch a parade which included cultural floats and a military parade of soldiers from the newly established East Pakistan Army. In Pakistan the reaction was more mute. The new leader of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto stated he would maintain the state as is until the next elections. At this point many in Pakistan accepted this result was inevitable so there has been a quiet acceptance."
 DemRahman1970.13.d:0 "Since the last constitution came into effect, a much stronger effort was made to better recruit ethnic groups proportional to their representation within Pakistan. Although many senior officers were Pakistanis, there were a large number of young Bengali officers and soldiers. The vast majority of whom signed up to join the East Pakistan Army. We are also committed to hand the East Pakistan military its share of our equipment. This leaves a big headache for GHQ who suddenly find a lack of manpower and assets to call upon. However, the provinces of Pakistan were historically a major source of military manpower across the subcontinent and many volunteers can eagerly be found. More importantly, Pakistan does have ample reserves as well. Pakistan will be fine but restructuring the military to tap these sources will take time and effort."
 DemRahman1970.14.d:0 "As part of the initiative of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to transform Pakistan into a socialist economy, the national assembly passed the Nationalization of Essential Industries Act. This bill calls for the nationalization of the petroleum and electric industries. The government argued these are vital industries that should not put citizens at the mercy of capitalist price gauging or under the control of private corporations. With the bill passed, the President directed federal resources to begin the process of bringing these companies under government supervision."

 Dem_Ayub65.1.d:0 "The people of Pakistan went to the polls to elect a new National Assembly and President for Pakistan. This is the first election under the new constitution. The people of Pakistan have two choices. They can either go with President Ayub Khan, who established the new constitution and guided the nation to these elections. He currently controls an alliance of centrist and right leaning parties. Or they can go with the fiery Bengali politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who leads a leftist coalition. Ayub Khan embraces a capitalistic development plan and strong central government. Mujibur Rahman wishes to curtail worker exploitation, bring socialism, and expand provincial autonomy."
 Dem_Ayub65.2.d:0 "Pakistan Television (PTV) started its first broadcast last night. The new state television plans on delivering news reports, cultural programs, and entertainment for all citizens. President Ayub Khan in a press release stated his hope the new media would help unite the people of Pakistan and show the world all the beauty that lies within the nation. Although the number of televisions in the country is low, experts believe that this new media will soon become widespread in time."
 Dem_Ayub65.3.d:0 "A senior American cabinet member met with President Ayub Khan. He stated the United States would appreciate help in its ongoing conflict in Vietnam. He stated the United States was looking for a commitment of at least one infantry division. In exchange the United States can provide economic support, equipment for two infantry divisions and half an armoured division. The people of Pakistan are generally sympathetic to the anti-colonial struggle of the Vietnamese and would not view our involvement positively. However, the military would no doubt really appreciate the extra equipment. However, there would likely be discontent among the junior officers and soldiers over the foreign deployment."
 Dem_Ayub65.4.d:0 "Pakistan President Ayub Khan informed us he could not provide an infantry division for combat duty in Vietnam. Instead he offered to send a medical unit. However, as we have no need for such services, we declined the request. This is a setback to our efforts at internationalizing Vietnam as a global conflict against communism. Some of our allies in Congress will be sure to point out that despite our history of aid to Pakistan, they appear reluctant to return the favor and aid us. The Pakistanis are mostly worried about their own conflicts in the region and the risk of domestic backlash if they sent troops."
 Dem_Ayub65.5.d:0 "President Ayub Khan informed us he would dispatch an infantry division for Vietnam. He stated his top military officers are already considering which unit to send and state Pakistan is proud to continue the historical legacy of South Asian military deployments abroad to ensure global security. His government will soon release a statement to the public explaining the decision was based on existing ties with the United States and a desire to aid the Vietnamese people against the evils of Soviet-style communism. We will soon give orders to dispatch the promised arms and cash to the Pakistani government."
 Dem_Ayub65.6.d:0 "Despite some large demonstrations by university students, the government of Pakistan confirmed an infantry division was embarking to deploy in Vietnam. The force is meant to aid in the security of Asia against a violent, European communist ideology. The Pakistanis are painstakingly avoiding criticism of all communism to avoid antagonizing China. Ever since the government announced its intentions, there have been protests by leftists and religious activists. Both accuse the government of supporting Western imperialism and selling Pakistani lives for cash. The Pakistan military appears supportive, but privately it seems many officers and soldiers worked hard to avoid being deployed abroad. Regardless, the Pakistan government remains committed and has refused to state what the American government is providing Pakistan in exchange for its help."

 KASHMIR_60s.1.d:0 "The Pakistani government has asked us to hold talks on the Kashmir crisis. It is likely they will seek the implementation of the UN resolutions. However, we can certainly see if they are interested in perhaps reaching a compromise. Some senior officials believe the current situation in Kashmir is not tolerable as a long-term solution and what happens in that state may negatively affect the wider Indian Union. They also fear the continued tension hinders the economy and international reputation of India. They believe we should hold the talks. Other members of the cabinet argue Kashmir is an integral part of India, it is not a matter for Pakistan or the international community at all. Indeed, Pakistan itself is the occupier and they are only acting like this to prevent their inevitable defeat. We must decide to hold talks or not to."
 KASHMIR_60s.2.d:0 "The Prime Minister and his delegation of senior diplomatic and military advisors have held several days of talks with a Pakistani delegation at the hill station of Murree. As predicted, the Pakistanis appeared focused on implementing the UN resolutions and arranging for a plebiscite in which the people of Jammu and Kashmir decide to either join India or Pakistan. Both sides agreed independence is not a viable option for Kashmir. With round two of talks about to begin, we must decide on an approach. One option is to call for the current border to be made permanent, with both sides recognizing the others sovereignty. The other option could be to propose a partition on strategic and communal lines. Pakistan would receive the Kashmir Valley, but we would retain Jammu and Ladakh. Finally, we can offer to implement the plebiscite and leave it to the people of Kashmir. Or we can just declare the talks failed and end it."
 KASHMIR_60s.3.d:0 "We are holding extensive talks with the Indian leadership. After much wrangling and discussion, they have given us a stance on Kashmir. They suggest making the current ceasefire line in Kashmir the permanent border. Pakistan and India would then renounce any claims to all of Kashmir. The normalization of the border would then be the basis of a renewed relationship between India and Pakistan. After the Indian presentation, the Pakistani leadership met privately to discuss a response. Two perspectives emerged during the fiery debate. One group saw the proposal as a sensible end to the dispute and a way to normalize Indo-Pakistan relations. Another group viewed it as a humiliating betrayal to the people of both Kashmir and Pakistan. They argue the talks should be ended and India be brought to the United Nations."
 KASHMIR_60s.4.d:0 "The Pakistan government announced the end of the Kashmir Conflict following the high-level talks in Murree. Pakistan and India agreed to make the ceasefire line in Kashmir the permanent border. The government stated the normalization of the border will lead to long-term peace, prosperity, and the reunion of Kashmiri people through a peaceful border. However, this optimistic statement was met by strong criticism from the Urdu newspapers and a lukewarm response from the English newspapers. Many articles criticized the government for betraying Kashmir to India and abandoning the vision of Pakistan. Across the nation thousands took to the streets to protest the government decision. Some religious leaders were detained by local police for calling for revolution. There are rumors of unrest among officers in the military who felt the government caved into Indian demands."
 KASHMIR_60s.5.d:0 "The Indian government announced the end of the Kashmir Conflict following the high-level talks in Murree. India and Pakistan agreed to make the ceasefire line in Kashmir the permanent border. In its statement, the government noted the animosity and threat of armed violence will soon dissipate and the people of India can look forward to more peace and prosperity. The current status of Kashmir within the Indian constitution will soon be adjusted to introduce Kashmir as a proper state within the Indian Union. Although the press has largely supported the government, viewing the agreement as a victory for it, there are some more radical publications which argued all of Kashmir should be part of India and the government had surrendered the land stolen by Pakistan in 1949 with the initial ceasefire agreement. Regardless of these criticisms, the agreement remains largely popular domestically and internationally India is viewed as the victor."
 KASHMIR_60s.6.d:0 "We are holding extensive talks with the Indian leadership. After much wrangling and discussion, they have given us a stance on Kashmir. They have suggested partitioning Kashmir along communal and strategic lines. In this proposal, both sides would renounce claims on the each other in Kashmir, Pakistan would receive the Kashmir Valley, including Srinagar. In exchange, India would retain control of Jammu and they insisted for strategic reasons they must also control Ladakh. The Pakistani leadership then met privately to discuss the proposal, with two potential responses emerging. One group sees the proposal as very advantageous, Pakistan would achieve its goal of liberating the Kashmir Valley. Jammu had a Hindu majority and Ladakh was an acceptable price. The other group however, argued the offer showed India was fearful of the UN being involved to force a plebiscite and Pakistan should end talks and take its chances at the UN for all of Kashmir."
 KASHMIR_60s.7.d:0 "An Azad Kashmir Infantry battalion from Pakistan entered Srinagar to take control of the city from the Indian government for Pakistan. In a smart ceremony, the two sides conducted a joint flag lowering and raising ceremony. The last Indian troops and officials left with full honors as per the recently agreed Indo-Pakistan Partition Plan that was signed during the Murree Conference on Kashmir. As Pakistani troops and officials moved into the Kashmir Valley, many Kashmiris followed close behind, hoping to reconnect with family separated during the first Kashmir War. Although some religious leaders and nationalists condemned the agreement for not securing all of Kashmir, many Pakistanis welcomed the move and see it as a favorable compromise which completed the promise Pakistan made to the Muslims of the Kashmir Valley. Reports of panic and communal clashes along the new border with Jammu did not dampen the news for Pakistanis."
 KASHMIR_60s.8.d:0 "Following the Murree Conference on Kashmir, many Indians, especially on the far right and far left were upset with the Indo-Pakistan Partition Plan. Those on the right opposed it as a surrender to Pakistan of sovereign Indian land. For the left, the agreement to partition along largely communal lines was condemned as against the spirit of Indian secularism. Regardless, the Indian government and military largely succeeded in handing over the Kashmir Valley with honor. Incidents of communal violence along the new border in Jammu were minimized thanks to the action of Indian forces in the area. Many Hindu Kashmiri refugees from the First Kashmir War have launched protests and called the agreement a betrayal and legitimization to Pakistani violence. Regardless, many now hope that Pakistan and India can transform their relationship from one of animosity to one of friendship."
 KASHMIR_60s.9.d:0 "We are holding extensive talks with the Indian leadership. After much wrangling and discussion, they have given us a stance on Kashmir. Much to the shock of the Pakistani leaders, the Indian government offered to implement the UN resolutions and allow the organization to hold a plebiscite on the final status of Kashmir. The Pakistani leadership met to discuss the unbelievable turn of events. As the Indians were offering what Pakistan had demanded from the beginning, there was not much to discuss. The Pakistanis returned and agreed to the Indian offer. Both nations dispatched their top diplomats to the United Nations in order to prepare the ground for implementing the resolutions."
 KASHMIR_60s.10.d:0 "Pakistan hosted India for high level talks at the hill station in Murree for the Murree Conference on Kashmir. The talks unfortunately ended in failure. Neither side appeared willing or prepared to make compromises on their stance. When the Indian delegation returned home its members were quoted as saying Pakistan harbored unrealistic expectations and exhibited a naked desire for Indian territory. The Pakistani government released a statement blaming India for a lack of flexibility and a desire to perpetuate an unlawful occupation. The Pakistan Foreign Ministry announced its intentions to present a resolution to the United Nations calling for sanctions until India agrees to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir."

 UN_KASHMIR.1.d:0 "The Pakistani government dispatched its top diplomats to the United Nations in order to present a resolution demanding India implement UN Resolution 47 or face economic sanctions from the international community. The Pakistan delegation noted India had largely refused to discuss Kashmir or offer any realistic avenue to a just resolution. Because of this, Pakistan is now turning to the United Nations for justice and resolution. The resolution is expected to reach the Security Council and Pakistan is hoping both the United States and Soviet Union chose to not veto it. Indian diplomats are already talking with both nations, emphasizing their position and opposition to what they call international blackmail."
 UN_KASHMIR.2.d:0 "A recent Pakistani resolution calling on India to implement UN Resolution 47, which calls for a plebiscite in Kashmir, or else face sanctions is currently being considered by diplomats of the Security Council. The Indian government has already expressed its desire for us to veto the resolution, saying if enacted, the economic sanctions would mostly hurt Indian trade partners. Some diplomats agree and state despite our friendship to Pakistan, sacrificing opportunities in India would be foolish. Other advisors point to Indian neutrality and rumored flirtations with the Soviet Union. They believe we should not use the veto, preserving our ties with Pakistan and demonstrating our commitment to the United Nations system we have spent so much time and energy establishing."
 UN_KASHMIR.3.d:0 "A recent Pakistani resolution calling on India to implement UN Resolution 47, which calls for a plebiscite in Kashmir, or else face sanctions is currently being considered by diplomats of the Security Council. The Indian government has already expressed its desire for us to veto the resolution, saying if enacted, the economic sanctions would mostly hurt Indian trade partners. Unlike Pakistan, India has at time proven to be open minded to our state and ideology. Vetoing may improve relations and help push India closer to our orbit. Other advisors, however, point out letting the resolution go on may help our ties with Pakistan, and give us more diplomatic clout with India. By not vetoing, we will pressure India into more firmly supporting the Soviet Union and avoid neutrality or a pro-Western orientation."
 UN_KASHMIR.4.d:0 "The American delegation at the Security Council announced the United States would veto the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir. Afterwards, American diplomats were quick to say how much they sympathized with the people of Kashmir and understood the frustration of Pakistan. However, they stated the UN was a place of international peace and on principle America could not endorse such a resolution which threatened a member state with sanctions if they failed to comply. The Pakistani delegation appeared quite openly dejected and the news has already sparked some anti-American editorials and protests."
 UN_KASHMIR.5.d:0 "During a recent Security Council meeting, the Soviet delegation indicated it would veto the recent Pakistan resolution on Kashmir. This marks a major blow to a recent diplomatic effort by Pakistan to reach a resolution on the Kashmir dispute. After the meeting, Soviet diplomats stated they felt the resolution appeared one sided. In Pakistan, the government is said to be furious over the setback, with opposition politicians blaming the government for the failed attempt. Anti-Soviet protests have erupted in major cities. The Indian government has announced its appreciation and thanks to the Soviets for stopping what they felt was a biased resolution."
 UN_KASHMIR.6.d:0 "After some adjustments in the wording, the resolution calling for the implementation of Resolution 47 by India passed. This new resolution, championed by Pakistan and its supporters, calls on us to implement the three stages outlined in resolution 47 to complete a plebiscite across the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. If we do not comply and agree to hold the plebiscite, the United Nations will place economic sanctions on our nation. However, the new wording makes the extent of sanctions vague. The cabinet is divided, some are advocating we implement Resolution 47 and hope Kashmir makes the right choice. Others argue the resolution is a blatant infringement on our sovereignty and the will of the Kashmiri people. They say we should refuse and take the sanctions. India is far too big of an economy to be sanctioned for a long period of time."
 UN_KASHMIR.7.d:0 "A defiant Indian government statement called the recent United Nations Security Council resolution illegal and a blatant violation of India sovereignty. The Indian government further added that the nation did not achieve its freedom from colonial exploitation only to be abused by the international community. The Pakistan government quickly condemned the Indian response and called on the international community to implement the sanctions. The United States and Soviet Union both expressed concern over the situation but did not specify plans on how or if they would put sanctions in response"
 UN_KASHMIR.8.d:0 "Our decision to reject the recent UN resolution has triggered many nations to implement some forms of economic sanctions on our country. However, the resolution only passed after the wording on the extent of sanctions was made vague. This means that though our economy will be severely hurt, the sanctions should not be as crippling as the Pakistanis hoped. The United Nations also stated the sanctions would immediately be lifted if we agree to hold a plebiscite as outlined in UN resolution 47. Many foreign and economic advisors predict these sanctions are not likely to be permanent and with patience we might even see them completely lifted."
 UN_KASHMIR.9.d:0 "As many of our experts predicted, the sanctions placed on us by the United Nations are being relaxed by many nations. It appears many nations are worried about losing opportunities of reaching our markets or securing valuable contracts from our government. There are still sanctions and they are having an impact, but these are being lessoned. Experts now predict a complete end to the sanctions can be expected in the long-term. The option to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir is still available and if implemented this would end all sanctions."
 UN_KASHMIR.10.d:0 "The Indian government announced it will implement UN resolution 47 and with Pakistan prepare the groundwork for a vote in Kashmir. The Indian government insisted this was not done out of coercion but after its own officials concluded such an election can be held. The Indian government added it would only complete the three-phase plan as long as Pakistan did not seek to violate or interfere with the electoral process. A United Nations force is quickly being assembled to secure the ceasefire line in Kashmir and lay the groundwork for the plebiscite and maintain peace in the region. The United Nations Secretary General in a statement welcomed the news but stated the implementation of resolution 47 would take time, patience, and cooperation to succeed."
 UN_KASHMIR.11.d:0 "A large United Nations force has arrived at the ceasefire line separating the Indian and Pakistan controlled areas of Kashmir. They have joined the already existing UN observation group who are providing valuable knowledge of the region. The UN forces are expected to hold separate briefings with both the Pakistani and Indian military commanders. The UN force is to see the withdrawal of Pakistani forces first, and then the withdrawal of Indian forces. Once this is achieved, the plebiscite will be held. During that vote, the people of Kashmir will finally decide their future destiny."
 UN_KASHMIR.12.d:0 "The Pakistan military in Kashmir has begun withdrawing its forces outside the historical boundaries of the Jammu and Kashmir Princely State. The Indian government initially tried to place its own local police in the area to maintain law and order with UN forces, however, the UN military command stated the Pakistani trained police in the area were capable of maintaining law and order. It noted resolution 80 equated Azad Kashmir forces with Jammu and Kashmir State forces. Pakistani officers and soldiers looked incredibly nervous as they loaded up their gear and began moving from the frontline. There are fears India may take this opportunity to renegade on the agreement and seize Kashmir, however, many analysts believe India would risk harming international peacekeepers with such an action."
 UN_KASHMIR.13.d:0 "As our forces begin their orderly withdrawal from Kashmir, as per the UN directives on implementing the plebiscite, some commanders are expressing concern for potential Indian traps. The UN resolution said the military forces of Pakistan and India were to withdraw, but we have local paramilitary forces who are not Pakistan Army regulars. In particular, the Gilgit Scouts were a militia force levied from locals. We can easily insist these forces remain in Kashmir as a law and order unit. The UN commander can easily be convinced. We will leave behind several of our top officers and soldiers with the Gilgit Scouts, along with extra equipment, in case there are any issues with the vote."
 UN_KASHMIR.14.d:0 "The Indian Army and Air Force have begun withdrawing their own forces from Kashmir. As per the resolution, they only began the process when it became clear Pakistan was completing their own withdrawal. The UN forces were impressed by the discipline and professionalism exhibited by the Indian forces as they left the frontlines. One Indian officer, speaking off the record explained his optimism that Indian troops would soon return once the Kashmiri people confirmed their desire to join India. Once the Indian withdrawal is confirmed, the United Nations must appoint a Plebiscite Overseer to ensure the election occurs without any issues."
 UN_KASHMIR.15.d:0 "The UN resolution is clear we must withdraw our regular military forces, however, we are to leave local police to ensure law and order. The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles were part of the Kashmir Princely State forces and we can easily convince the UN command to allow us to leave several battalions behind for security. With these troops we can leave extra equipment and some of our top officers and troops. These force would be a contingency to prevent Pakistani chicanery or any issues that may arise after the plebiscite."
 UN_KASHMIR.16.d:0 "The specially appointed United Nations Plebiscite Administrator, General Viscount Slim, arrived in Srinagar to oversee the plebiscite in Kashmir. The former British Indian Army commander is highly respected by officers in both India and Pakistan. General Slim in his initial statement said he hoped a free and fair election will lead to future peace and prosperity between India and Pakistan. He added that free and fair elections will be held as soon as possible. The original Plebiscite Administrator, Admiral Chester Nimitz was no longer available for the role."
 UN_KASHMIR.17.d:0 "Across Kashmir, the people came in huge numbers to vote. Although some expressed disappointment that independence was not an option in the vote, many were simply thankful to have the option. For many Kashmiris, this is a vital vote. Many are attracted to the idea of joining Pakistan and have a Muslim homeland. For others, especially among minority Hindus and Sikhs, India represents a secular dream of equality and prosperity. The people of both Pakistan and India are eagerly awaiting the results of this vote and what it means for the future of South Asia."
 UN_KASHMIR.18.d:0 "The United Nations Plebiscite Administrator announced that the people of Kashmir have voted to join Pakistan. Newspapers across Pakistan quickly fired new editions proclaiming the historic result. Spontaneous scenes of celebration occurred across all major cities and towns. The Pakistan government quickly released a statement expressing its satisfaction that the people of Kashmir were able to finally exercise their right to self-determination. The government also noted that minorities in Kashmir should have no fear and that Pakistan would protect all its citizens. The Indian government has yet to release a statement on the matter."
 UN_KASHMIR.19.d:0 "The United Nations announced the results of the vote. This is a shocking result and there are fears among our officials that Pakistan manipulated the results in their favor. Of more concern are reports that minorities across Kashmir are fleeing or preparing to leave before the Pakistanis arrive. It is clear that the Pakistanis cannot be trusted to protect these people from communal violence and indeed there are some reports of Muslim Kashmiris targeting non-Muslim neighbors. Thankfully, the Indian Army has informed us that the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, still in Kashmir, can quickly secure Jammu and protect the minorities from further violence. Such an act will no doubt provoke the ire of Pakistan."
 UN_KASHMIR.20.d:0 "The United Nations Plebiscite Administrator announced that the people of Kashmir have voted to join India. Newspapers and radio broadcasts were quick to announce the exciting news. Spontaneous crowds emerged in cities across India to celebrate the result. The Indian government released a statement calling the vote a triumph for Indian democracy and secularism. It added that all Kashmiris will enjoy the same level of freedom as any other citizen. The Pakistan government has remained quiet but reports of angry protests and violence in Pakistani cities are being confirmed by international observers. There are some reports of the areas formerly controlled by Pakistan that the vote was rigged, leading to reports of agitation. Regardless, the result is being seen as a major Indian success."
 UN_KASHMIR.21.d:0 "From the results announced by the United Nations, it is clear that India engaged in massive manipulation to get the result they wanted. Already our Kashmiri brothers are desperately trying to flee to Pakistani territory in the hopes of avoiding renewed anti-Muslim Indian oppression. Fortunately, the Pakistan Army left behind the Gilgit Scouts for such a contingency. If we give the order, our troops should be able to secure Gilgit-Baltistan, protecting the Pakistani border and offering a safe haven for the refugees desiring freedom. The people of Pakistan are hurting from the results and are demanding action."
