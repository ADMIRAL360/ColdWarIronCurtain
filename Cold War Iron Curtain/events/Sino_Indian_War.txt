####### SINO-INDIAN WAR ########
################################

New Maps Spark Tensions with China 
-Launch Diplomatic effort (opens/completes focus option for IND_Attempt_Diplomatic_Effort but keeps IND_Implement_Forward_Policy unavailable, event “Chinese Incursions” fires in two weeks, historical)
-Prepare Military Options (open focus option for IND_Implement_Forward_Policy but keeps IND_Attempt_Diplomatic_Effort unavailable, , event “Chinese Incursions” fires in two weeks)

Chinese Incursions (Indian event)
-Damn it (spirit “Chinese Incursions” for 6 months, which should have a stability drop)

India Proposes Talks over Border (China event from IND_Open_Talks_With _China)
-Accept the offer (leads to event “China Meets with Indian Leaders to Discuss Border” in 15 days, historical)
-Decline (India gets event “Sino-Indian Border Talks are Inconclusive” in 15 days)

China Meets with Indian Leaders to Discuss Border (global event)
-Talks open (in a couple days, China gets “India Asks for Aksai Chin”)

Sino-Indian Border Talks are Successful (India/China)

Sino-Indian Border Talks are Inconclusive (historical)
-Oh well (Chinese-Indian relations big drop, even trade relations, the focus IND_Implement_Forward_Policy should now be available, if the player wants they can start the path to the Indo-Sino War now that the diplomatic path has failed)

Implement Forward Policy in NEFA (event from IND_Implement_Forward_Policy)
-Excellent (3 year spirit “Forward Policy in NEFA” some military modifiers, positive and negative, if “himalayan defence” spirit still active, that should be removed)

Deploy North of McMahon Line (Event from Ind_Deploy_North_of_McMahon_Line)
-Move forward! (triggers a decision category to launch the event chain that may lead to a border war, India should only have a couple years at most to start the event chain for a border war)

India Advances Over the McMahon Line (Chinese event, triggered when India launches the decision to advance)

-Big victory (India event “China Calls for Restoration of Borders”)

China Calls for Restoration of Borders (India event)
-Accept the deal (prewar borders restored, China cancels claims to NEFA, India gets spirit “Victory in Himalayas” for 3 years)
-Refuse (China gets event “Evict the Indian Intruders?”)

Evict the Indian Intruders? (China event)
-Evict the Indians! (India gets event in 15 days “Chinese Offensive in NEFA”)

Chinese Offensive in NEFA (India/China event)
-So it begins (China attacks India and starts a border war between India/China, Pakistan gets event “Press India in Northern Kashmir?” In 3 days

Press India in Northern Kashmir? (decision for Pakistan that comes when India/China border war starts, if Pakistan picks the decision, launches a border war with India)
-Launch the attack (start a border war along the Haji Pir and Burzil passes, Pakistan gains 3 month spirit “Surprise Attack” giving them military bonuses, India gets event, “Pakistan Launches Kashmir Offensive”)
-Stand down (nothing, Pakistan no longer participates in the event chain, historical)

Pakistan Launches Kashmir Offensive (Indian event)
-Damn it (inform india aware border war has started)

Pakistan Troops Advance Towards Srinagar (if Pakistan wins border war, Pakistan/India event)
-So the fighting ends (the two territories between the two passes and north of Srinagar are ceded to Pakistan)

-To War! (declare war on India)

India Returns Land for Guarantee (China event)
-At least the fighting has stopped (India returns pre-war boundaries, China removes claims to NEFA, India gets event “Victory in NEFA”, 3 year China spirit “Defeat in India Conflict”)

Victory in NEFA (Indian event)
-Excellent (3 year spirit for India “Victory in NEFA”)

Indian Forces Pushed Back (if India loses border war, Chinese event)
-Press on! (China invades India, declares war, event “Involve Sikkim?”)
-Seize NEFA (“Accept the Chinese Gains?” event)
-Return lands and announce victory (“China Announces Ceasefire in India Conflict”, historical)

Involve Sikkim? (China event, if it starts a general war with India)
-Liberate Sikkim! (Declare war on Sikkim)
-Leave it be (nothing happens)

Accept Chinese Gains? (India event)
-Leave it be (NEFA ceded to China permanently, India gains 3 year spirit “Defeat in NEFA”, China gets event “Victory in Himalayan Campaign”)
-This cannot stand (Declare war on China)

China Announces Ceasefire in India Conflict (India event)
-At least it is over (India gains 3 year spirit “Defeat in NEFA”, China gets event “Victory in Himalayan Campaign”)

Victory in Himalayan Campaign (China event)
-Excellent (China gets 3 year spirit “Victory in Himalayas”)
India Desperately Calls for Aid (US event) (event from IND_Appeal_For_International_Support)

-Provide aid (Pakistan-US relations drop, India gets “Western Military Aid Arrives” in 2 weeks, historical)
-We cannot aid them (US-India relations drop, 1 year spirit for US “Failed to Support India”, would impact domestic US support as media would condemn failure to standup to communist aggression)

Western Military Aid Arrives (Indian event)
-Excellent (India receives enough military equipment from America to equip 3 mountain divisions, India-US relations boost, India-Soviet relations drop, India-Pakistan relations drop)

Soviets and Americans Warn Against Escalation (China/Indian event forcing an end to the conflict in 30 days)
-Damn it (event “UN Ceasefire Comes into Effect” fires in 30 days)

UN Ceasefire Comes into Effect (fighting ends, peace events launch)
-An end to the fighting (end of war events kick in, Sino-Indian War stops, everyone stays in place)

India Gains McMahon Line (If at ceasefire India is occupying its claimed territories along McMahon line)
-McMahon Line no more (India gains control of the McMahon line area)

India Controls Aksai Chin (If at ceasefire India is controlling Aksai Chin)
-China out of Kashmir? (Aksai Chin ceded to India)
