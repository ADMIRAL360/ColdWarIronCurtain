If Chinese are Curbstomping the Indians in 1962 during the CMC
Fired from Soviets Response to American Blockade

Soviet's Offer Talks over the Crisis (To America)
CMC_Sino_India_War.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union offered an overture indicating their interest in a compromise to resolve the crisis in Cuba. The current proposal for Cuba calls for the Soviets to remove their offensive missiles from the island while we remove nuclear missiles from Turkey. The Soviet government also noted the Chinese government used the recent crisis between us to attack India and are currently overwhelming Indian defenses. The Soviet Union appear interested in holding further talks with regards to China, once we agree on the compromise. This represents a potential opportunity to drive a wedge in the communist camp. Many cabinet and defense officials note the United States and Soviet Union have a shared interest in limiting Chinese expansionism in Asia and maintaining international order."
-Agree to Missile Removals in Turkey/Cuba

America Agrees to Remove Missiles and Continue Talks (to Soviets)
CMC_Sino_India_War.2.d:0 "The American President agreed on a compromise to resolve the tensions in Cuba. Our forces will withdraw nuclear weapons from the island in exchange for the American removal of offensive missiles in Turkey. The President also concurred with our concerns over China and will host us for immediate talks on the issue. The Chinese continue to wage a brutal war of aggression on India, seeking to export a flawed vision of socialism with violence. Such a path will only strengthen their belligerence and ideologically split global communism from the newly independent states. We will quietly dispatch a diplomatic team to hold further talks with regards to the Chinese immediately."
-Excellent (Fires "The China Problem" (Part 2 of the Talks))

Fired from Soviet Response to American Invasion
Soviet's Request Secret Meetings ( to America)
CMC_Sino_India_War.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union sent a private message calling for secret negotiations to find a way out of the current crisis. The communist world remains infuriated by our just decision to intervene in Cuba to protect our borders and neutralize Soviet missile sites. Tensions are increasing by the hour, especially after the Soviets seized Berlin. Our leading advisors argue we should accept the offer to negotiate, noting permanent military occupation in Cuba cannot be the best solution for the long-term. They also point out a failure to even hear the Soviets out will only risk further escalation and alienate our concerned European allies. Negotiations to resolve the current global shift appears to be an attractive option. However, top military advisors believe the talks are only a distraction meant to trick the United States into giving up its current advantage."
-Accept
-Reject (Fires Americans Reject    (Ends the Talks))

Americans Accept
CMC_Sino_India_War.4.d:0 "The American armed forces continue their brutal occupation of Cuba. The United States claim it was forced to act due to the deployment of our own missile systems on the island. We have a moral obligation to aid the Cuban people and defend socialism from such acts of naked aggression. We responded by liberating Berlin to show the socialist world cannot tolerate imperialist aggression. However, the existing environment is increasingly hostile, and our government recently invited the United States for secret negotiations to calm the atmosphere. The Americans agreed and our top officials are receiving instructions on how to discuss the situation in Cuba and Berlin once the talks begin."
-Great

Secret Talks with the Soviets Begin (American Perspective)
CMC_Sino_India_War.5.d:0 "We recently opened secret talks with the Soviet Union over our justified intervention in Cuba and their gutless seizure of Berlin. From the early talks it appears we have two ways of resolving this conflict. One would be to restore the pre-intervention atmosphere, that would mean a withdrawal of our military forces from Cuba in return for the restoration of Berlin. This option would restore the pre-crisis norm. The other option is for the Soviet Union to accept a non-communist regime in Cuba in exchange for our recognition of Berlin being a part of the GDR. This proposal would turn the recent escalation into a new norm and re-establish a baseline of normalcy. We must consider if a pro-US Cuban regime is worth the symbolic loss of Berlin and anger from our European allies."
-Request the Return of Berlin
-Seek Recognition of the Trade of Berlin for Cuba

American's Request Formal Agreement of Non-Intervention into Cuba in Exchange for Berlin
CMC_Sino_India_War.6.d:0 "The United States proposed we accept a non-communist regime in Havana in exchange for their recognition of Berlin as part of the GDR. This proposal will essentially transform the current international situation into the new status quo. Gaining Berlin offers a major symbolic victory, greatly strengthening our position in Europe. Cuba had only recently become an ally and some officials believe losing Cuba for Berlin is not a bad trade. However, other senior officials note the loss of Cuba cripples the Soviet presence in the Americas and hurts our standing among Latin American socialist movements. These officials recommend we instead offer to return West Berlin in exchange for the immediate American military withdrawal from Cuba, restoring its socialist regime. A decision must be made to the proposal."
-Excellent
-Request American's Pull Out of Cuba in Exchange for Berlin
	
Soviet's Agree to Terms
CMC_Sino_India_War.7.d:0 "The Soviet Union agreed to our proposal to recognize and not undermine a non-communist regime in Cuba in exchange for our government recognizing the GDR as the controlling power of Berlin. The agreement will likely immediately reduce tensions and establish a new status quo. Berlin and Cuba are no longer direct flashpoints, however, we will likely face intense criticism from fellow NATO powers for giving up Berlin. In the end, our analysis recognizes a friendly Cuba offers far more to the global struggle against socialism than maintaining a symbolic presence in West Berlin. The Soviets will feel much more secure in Europe but no longer possess an easy route to infect socialism to Latin America. This part of the negotiations has concluded, however, the Soviets wish to discuss the ongoing Indo-Sino conflict with us."
-On to the China Issue

Soviet's Offer Berlin for Cuba Withdrawal
CMC_Sino_India_War.8.d:0 "The Soviet Union countered our offer with a proposal to return West Berlin in exchange for our complete withdrawal from Cuba. Essentially the Soviets would like to re-establish the pre-crisis situation. Our State Department experts believe this is a fair proposal and ensures all parties can be comfortable that neither side gained in the conflict. More importantly, regaining Berlin will restore confidence and support from our key European allies. Senior defense officials are not happy with the proposal. They believe losing Cuba, considering its valuable resources and geographic location is not worth gaining Berlin which is largely of symbolic value. They argue we should reject the proposal and maintain our advantage, despite the risk in raising tensions."
-No deal
-It's a deal

Americans Accept
CMC_Sino_India_War.9.d:0 "The United States showed a return to clarity by agreeing to our proposal. The United States will withdraw from Cuba, allowing its government to return. In exchange, we will return West Berlin to the West. This decision returns the world to the pre-crisis state and will go a long way to reduce tensions. However, the Chinese are currently brutally attacking India, this blatant aggression is undermining the rise of socialism in Asia. We will continue our discussions with the Americans to see if they can be brought in to firmly halt an increasingly erratic Chinese state."
-On to the China Issue

Americans Reject    (Ends the Talks)
CMC_Sino_India_War.10.d:0 "The United States unfortunately revealed their imperialist colors by refusing our compromise proposal. We sought to restore the pre-crisis state and reduce tensions. However, the Americans remain committed to forcibly repressing the Cuban people with military force and a puppet regime. We will remain extra vigilant with regards to Western aggression. The situation in India is deteriorating, with China continuing its excessive aggression towards it. The Indians have desperately called for any aid, and the Chinese remain committed to their erratic policies, greatly hindering the progress of socialism in Asia. We can take the decision to intervene invade China, to restore order and bring China to heel. Some officials however, advocate this may only exacerbate an already tense international atmosphere and we should not intervene to calm tensions. The Politburo must decide on a course of action."
-Unfortunate but we must calm tensions (Ends the chain and leaves India out to dry)
-Invade China (To Bail Out India)

American-Soviet Agreement on the Cuban Crisis
CMC_Sino_India_War.11.d:0 "In a joint statement, the United States and Soviet Union revealed an agreement to resolve the current global crisis. The news came as a relief and surprise to many across the globe who were unaware the two rivals were engaged in private talks to resolve the crisis. The agreement recognizes the new, democratic regime installed in Cuba by the United States. The Western powers in turn will recognize Berlin as under the authority of the German Democratic Republic. Although the United States and Soviets appear satisfied with the new territorial changes, Western European states area already expressing outrage over the abandonment of Berlin. Socialist parties across the newly independent states and especially Latin America are condemning Moscow for abandoning Cuba."
-Peace for now?

US-Soviet Agree to Restore Status Quo
CMC_Sino_India_War.12.d:0 "In a joint statement, the United States and Soviet Union revealed an agreement to resolve the current global crisis. The news came as a relief and surprise to many across the globe who were unaware the two rivals were engaged in private talks to resolve the crisis. The agreement restores the previous status quo. The United States will immediately withdraw its forces from Cuba and allow the previous regime to return. At the same time the Soviet forces in West Berlin will withdraw and restore it to the Western powers. Capitals across the globe are warmly receiving the agreement as a key step to de-escalating the recent spike in tension."
-Peace for now?

The China Problem (Part 2 of the Talks)
CMC_Sino_India_War.13.d:0 "During the second phase of negotiations with the United States, we pointed out the deteriorating situation in Asia. The Chinese government is maintaining a war of conquest against India, threatening to upset the international balance and shift the balance of power. India has called for both of our states to intervene. The Americans are interested in hearing our ideas on dealing with this threat. One option is to assemble a coalition of allies to militarily force China into submission. Another solution could be a joint nuclear strike on China to cripple their war machine. Finally, we can intervene against China ourselves, to relieve pressure on India, and just let the Americans know ahead of time."

Soviet Notification of Plans to Strike China
CMC_Sino_India_War.14.d:0 "During our negotiations, the Soviet Union informed us that they plan on invading China in the coming days. The Soviets believe a military intervention is the only way to relieve the beleaguered Indian government. Our own analysts note the Chinese military is currently focused on India leaving them especially vulnerable to a Soviet offensive. The Soviet action is certainly welcomed by our government, it means the two largest communist states are at war with one another and India will be spared communist occupation. However, a few advisors noted a decisive Soviet victory could help them regain control of the socialist camp and firmly bring India into its orbit. But this is a risk we have to take as an Asia dominated by the communist Chinese cannot be tolerated."
-Excellent

Soviet's Seek Joint Nuclear Strike on the PRC
CMC_Sino_India_War.15.d:0 "During the recent talks, the Soviet Union called for a joint nuclear strike against the communist Chinese military. The Soviet representatives noted the Chinese were increasingly erratic and their war with India threatened to destabilize the entire structure in Asia. One diplomat claimed if their advance in India continues unchecked, all neighboring states would suddenly be at risk. Our own experts note a Chinese victory would give them wider legitimacy within the socialist camp and firmly establish China as the largest socialist bloc in the world. If we agree to launch such strikes, targeting its military, we believe China may be forced to halt and withdraw, providing India relief. However, other advisors fear such a nuclear strike could setup a dangerous precedent and leave China to be gobbled up by the Soviets. The President must decide."
-Agree
-Decline

Soviet's Propose Anti-Chinese Coalition w/Kashmir Solution
CMC_Sino_India_War.16.d:0 "The Soviet Union proposed a multinational solution to the current Indo-Sino War. They propose our two states, along with India and the Republic of China come together to fight back and defeat the brutal Chinese invasion. They also noted Pakistan could be invited to join on the condition India agrees to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir. We concurred that with a guarantee on Kashmir, Pakistan may be very interested in establishing a coalition that truly challenges China across all her borders. It would certainly be a positive result for our government to neuter a major communist threat in Asia while protecting India. However, many advisors fear such a conflict could turn into a protracted land war and fighting with the Soviets would be unpopular with American conservatives. A decision must be made soon."
-Notify Coalition Members for War (Event to Pakistan, India, RoC)
-Reject

American's Reject Coalition
CMC_Sino_India_War.17.d:0 "The United States stated they could not join or endorse a military coalition to counter the Chinese invasion of India. The American President is no doubt unwilling to ally with our nation and risk losing precious votes. The greater good does not trump capitalistic impulses. This is a setback but the Americans were clear they found the situation with India greatly disturbing. We are now left with two options, we can either just leave the situation alone and hope for a just resolution or intervene. Our commanders are confident the moment is perfect to attack China while it is distracted, allowing us to neutralize a clear ideological rival without the risk of American hostility. However, war is always fraught with risks, and a number of officials argue leaving the situation alone remains the wisest choice. The Politburo will debate and decide which course of action to take."
-Unfortunate (Ends Chain)
-Strike China (Declares war on PRC, launches invasion events globally and the Project National Glory one)

American's Accept Coalition
CMC_Sino_India_War.18.d:0 "The United States accepted our offer to form a coalition to challenge the Chinese and halt their invasion of India. We will formally notify select, strategic states to join our coalition, including India, and then start the conflict. Orders are being sent to our forces on the Chinese border, with commanders instructed to prepare for operations. The United States promises to offer not just military but diplomatic support to back our operations. The erratic foreign adventures and ideological challenges from China will soon be silenced and we will restore order to the progress of socialism in Asia."
-Prepare for War (War fires in 10 Days along with Global News Events)

Anti-Chinese Coalition Formed (Taiwan/India/Pakistan Versions) (If has Kashmiri Deal Included needs alternate description)
CMC_Sino_India_War.19.d:0 "The Indo-Sino War appeared to be turning into a major setback for India. However, the United States and Soviet Union decided to intervene and formed a coalition to organize an effective response. Our nation joined the coalition to check Chinese expansionism and restore peace in Asia. We released statements and directed the media to explain why we are joining the coalition. If China is not halted in India, our own borders will be threatened next. Soviet and American military officials are arriving to meet with our senior commanders to coordinate and determine how we can effectively contribute to the success of the coalition."

Anti-Chinese Coalition Formed (India w/Kashmir)
CMC_Sino_India_War.20.d:0 "The world answered our calls for help. The United States and Soviet Union agreed to form a coalition against China and invited us to join. We agreed to join the coalition, with other partners including Pakistan. However, Pakistan only joined with a promise from us to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir after the conflict. This is a major concession, however, Pakistan promises to provide a large number of troops and as our neighbors their forces can rapidly move in support. Support the government could not forsake at this dire state. For the first time since the end of colonialism, the military might of South Asia will be united. This, combined with the support of our coalition allies should be more than enough to end the Chinese threat."  

Anti-Chinese Coalition Formed (Pakistan w/Kashmir)
CMC_Sino_India_War.21.d:0 "We recently agreed to join the American and Soviet coalition against China. This is in reaction to the ongoing Indo-Sino War to provide support to the beleaguered Indians. Although we have a pact with India, the Kashmir dispute meant Pakistan could not in good conscious send troops while India remains defiant on the issue. However, the coalition, including India, vowed to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir if Pakistan participated. With this, Pakistan could happily join the coalition and offer its military might in defense of South Asia. Many of our commanders trained or served with their Indian counterparts during the World War. Already plans are being made to coordinate efforts and deploy Pakistanis in support of coalition operations. The synergy of Pakistan and Indian forces will no doubt ensure the Chinese are not just halted but thrown back, then Kashmir can chose its destiny."

Soviet's Propose Anti-Chinese Coalition wo/Kashmir Solution
CMC_Sino_India_War.22.d:0 "The Soviet representatives, after outlining the extreme threat posed by the Chinese and their military adventure in India, proposed establishing a coalition to end the Chinese threat. India would be a natural ally, as would the Republic of China. Pakistan would likely not be willing or able to participate as long as the Kashmir dispute with India remains. Regardless, the Soviets believe their proposed coalition has the military might and strategic positioning to rapidly overwhelm and neutralize China. We must consider this proposal carefully, certainly defeating communist China is an attractive proposition, but this may be at the cost of empowering the Soviet Union. Supporters for the coalition argue the proposed conflict will draw the two largest communist states into conflict and not moving in support of India will just surrender South Asia to Soviet influence."
(Fires same two accept/reject coalition events as the ones w/kashmir)

American's Agree (Fires Soviet-American Nuclear Strike on the PRC)
CMC_Sino_India_War.23.d:0 "The Americans agreed with our proposal to intervene and halt the Chinese aggression against India. More importantly, they have accepted our proposal to launch a joint nuclear strike on PLA military concentrations. Our top military officials are coordinating with their American counterparts to ensure a successful strike. Once launched, the Chinese will be militarily crippled. Enabling the Indians to drive them back. The erratic Chinese regime will suffer for its continued hostility and efforts to ideologically undermine the socialist world."

American's Decline (Ends Chain, Soviet's get option to invade China alone)
CMC_Sino_India_War.24.d:0 "The American government declined to intervene to halt Chinese aggression against India. We had hoped to coordinate a joint nuclear strike to destroy Chinese military concentrations and cripple their military capabilities. The refusal is a setback, however, our top military leaders are confident they can successfully intervene against China. We can certainly continue with our preparations to invade the distracted Chinese regime. However, there are those in the Politburo who have reservations, they fear such a conflict could create a schism among the socialist states and lead to a protracted conflict. A decision must be made."

Joint American-Soviet Nuclear Strike on China (Global)  #Limited in Scope, tactical nukes used on PRC forces with demands for withdrawal
CMC_Sino_India_War.25.d:0 "In a shocking development, the Soviet Union and United States jointly announced they had successfully launched nuclear weapons targeting the Chinese military. They claim their intervention is meant to halt the unjust Chinese invasion of India. There are reports of massive explosions and tremors reaching as far as New Delhi. This is a dramatic intervention into the conflict and a welcome relief to the beleaguered Indian government. The American and Soviet cooperation is stunning to many capitals and populations, as only weeks ago the two states appeared on the brink of all-out nuclear war. Neither government responded to questions on whether this cooperation will lead to a new alliance between the global superpowers."

Joint American-Soviet Nuclear Strike on China (China)
CMC_Sino_India_War.26.d:0 "The brave soldiers of the PLA were the victims of a cowardly but devastating nuclear strike by the Soviet Union and United States. Clearly the Soviets have betrayed the socialist cause and are now tools of global capitalism. Our forces and people suffered grievous losses. A joint message from the Soviets and Americans demands we halt our operations against India. They demand our withdrawal from Tibet, East Turkestan, along with ceding disputed territory to India and Pakistan. Specifically, they want India to receive Aksai Chin. Our initial reaction no doubt is to continue the struggle, even if we must return to the countryside, however, there are many in the Politburo who believe we may have to concede now. So we can regather our strength and strike back when the moment inevitably presents itself."
-Agree to Coalition Demands (Release Tibet, East Turkestan, Cede Aksai to india and Return Pakistani Land)
-Refuse (Coalition Declares War)

Americans Reject 
CMC_Sino_India_War.27.d:0 "The United States, during our recent discussion on the brutal Chinese invasion of India, refused to cooperate in anyway to bring the conflict to a swift end. This is a disappointment, but it also is clear the Americans would not oppose if we chose to intervene on our own. Our top military commanders insist we are in a position of strength with the PLA focused on India and believe a swift victory is possible and we can save India. However, there are Politburo members who are concerned any military conflict is rife with risk, and we should not escalate or involve ourselves in the conflict, even with American assurances. A decision must be made."
-Back Down
-Invade China (To Bail Out India)

Soviet Invasion of China (Global) (Soviet's Alone)
CMC_Sino_India_War.28.d:0 "The Soviet Union announced it cannot tolerate the current Chinese aggression against India and that is forces are rapidly moving across the border. The Soviets claim they are seeking to swiftly force the Chinese PLA to halt its aggression and cruel domestic policies. The Chinese government claims the Soviet forces are being repulsed and their aggression reveals their true colors as an imperialist state. With both sides claiming early success, it will take some time to determine the true condition on the ground. However, it is clear there is now an all-out war across Asia."

Anti-Chinese Coalition Formed (Without Pakistan and no Kashmiri Agreement; Begins War) (Without Nukes Fired First)
CMC_Sino_India_War.29.d:0 "The United States and Soviet Union announced the formation of a coalition to forcibly turnback the PLA forces invading India. The coalition consists of the two major powers, India, and the Republic of China. The Indian government welcomed the announcement and informed their people that help was on its way. Heavy clashes are expected at the Soviet-Chinese border in the coming hours. The Chinese government showed defiance, vowing to repel the imperialist forces surrounding them and claiming the PLA will not halt in its campaign of revolution."

Anti-Chinese Coalition Formed (With Pakistan, UN Resolution will be implemented at end of war; Begins War) (Without Nukes Fired First)
CMC_Sino_India_War.30.d:0 "The United States and Soviet Union announced the formation of a coalition to forcibly turnback the PLA forces invading India with military action. The coalition consists of the two major powers, India, Pakistan, and the Republic of China. The Indian government welcomed the announcement, informing its people all of South Asia is united to face the Chinese hordes. The coalition also confirmed reports form Pakistan that India has agreed to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir following the crisis. The Chinese government condemned the new coalition as an imperialist grouping motivated by territorial greed. It vowed to repel all invading forces surrounding them and not halt its campaign of revolution."

Anti-Chinese Coalition Launches Invasion (Without Pakistan and no Kashmiri Agreement; Begins War) (Chinese Reject Post Nuke Ultimatum)
CMC_Sino_India_War.31.d:0 "Following the US-Soviet joint nuclear strike on PLA formations, the Chinese government refused to cave into what it called naked imperialist demands. As a result, a coalition consisting of the Soviet Union, United States, India, and the Republic of China announced it would begin a military intervention against China. The coalition claims its forces will swiftly halt and drive off the PLA from not just India but all its illegally occupied territories. The Chinese government defiantly noted it would never cave in and would drive off all invaders."

Anti-Chinese Coalition Launches Invasion (With Pakistan, UN Resolution will be implemented at end of war; Begins War) (Chinese Reject Post Nuke Ultimatum)
CMC_Sino_India_War.32.d:0 "Following the US-Soviet joint nuclear strike on PLA formations, the Chinese government refused to cave into what it called naked imperialist demands. As a result, a coalition consisting of the Soviet Union, United States, India, Pakistan, and the Republic of China announced it would begin a military intervention against China. The coalition claims its forces will swiftly halt and drive off the PLA from not just India but all its illegally occupied territories. It also noted India and Pakistan had agreed to implement UN resolutions to resolve their border dispute in Kashmir following the conflict. The Chinese government defiantly noted it would never cave in and would drive off all invaders."

Initiating Project National Glory (To KMT from Soviet invasion if Soviet's invade alone)
CMC_Sino_India_War.33.d:0 "The recent Soviet Union invasion of the illegal regime occupying the mainland presents a unique opportunity. The PLA now faces conflict along its borders with the Soviets and Indians. Our top military officials believe the moment is right to initiate Project National Glory. We can launch our own invasion and begin the liberation of our people. However, there are some in the cabinet who urge caution, they argue the situation is still very fluid and may force us to compromise territorially with the Soviets. They argue the moment may not be right to launch the counterattack that will liberate our people. A decision must be made soon."
-Launch the Operation (KMT Invades PRC)
-The timing isnt right 

Project National Glory (Global)
CMC_Sino_India_War.34.d:0 "The Republic of China, based in Taiwan, declared the launch of Project National Glory. The government claims this is the long awaited counterattack that will finally free the mainland from communist oppression. KMT aligned forces are being directed to immediately begin the invasion and calls are being made for KMT sympathizers in the mainland to rise up against the PLA. The communist Chinese government immediately declared the PLA will easily repel this invasion and move to immediately liberate the rest of China. Analysts are raising concern that the current fighting in Asia is only continuing to escalate."

The Partitioning of China (Global if Coalition Wins) (East Turkestan, Tibet Freed; Inner Mongolia to Mongolia, Manchuria to Soviets, Chiang Takes the Rest, Fires UN Kashmir Chain)
CMC_Sino_India_War.35.d:0 "The PLA and the last remnants of their government officially capitulated to coalition forces, after a difficult campaign. India and Pakistan will receive their disputed territory from China. Tibet and East Turkestan will become independent. Mongolia is to receive Inner Mongolia. The Soviet Union will remain in control of Manchuria, claiming its forces are there to maintain order. The rest of the mainland is to be returned to the Republic of China. The United States welcomed the return of democracy to China. India and Pakistan are expected to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir in the coming weeks, with both claiming the action as the first step to a new era of cooperation."

India will receive their disputed territory from China. Tibet and East Turkestan will become independent. Mongolia is to receive Inner Mongolia. The Soviet Union will remain in control of Manchuria, claiming its forces are there to maintain order. The rest of the mainland is in theory still under the control of China, under Lin Biao. However, there are reports of major unrest and anarchy spreading as the government lacks legitimacy and military might."

They are promising the liberation of Kashmir, aside from Chinese claimed territory. This is certainly an intriguing proposal, especially with the other superpowers caught up in their own major conflict. The GHQ believes our forces are eager for conflict and ready to intervene. However, some senior cabinet members fear this may not be the right time. A failed intervention could cripple our forces and end any chance we have to liberate Kashmir in the future."
