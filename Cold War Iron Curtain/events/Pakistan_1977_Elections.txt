1977 General Elections (election event)
"The 1977 General Elections mark the first election under the new constitution. Voter turnout is expected to be high as the PPP launched an aggressive campaign to secure voters. The opposition parties have united to form the Pakistan National Alliance under famed opposition politician and anti-colonial activist Khan Abdul Wali Khan. In the leadup to the vote, PPP leader Zulfikar Bhutto held public rallies all over the country to broaden the base of PPP support. The PNA has used its alliance of regional and religious parties to launch a grassroots campaign condemning the PPP for corruption and a disastrous economic policy. It has been a bitter campaign with both sides exchanging harsh accusations against the other."
-PPP Wins! (leads to event, "Push for a Super Majority?"
-PNA Wins!

Push for Super Majority?
"It is clear the PPP will win a majority of seats for the election, securing another term for Zulfikar Bhutto as Prime Minister. In hindsight, it is actually very clear the PPP was likely to win over the PNA which failed to offer a concrete plan for governing Pakistan. The PPP electoral cell has received phone calls from certain party cadres who note there are a few seats with close races. They are asking for permission to help ensure the PPP candidates win those seats, in doing so we can enter parliament with a supermajority and not deal with delaying tactics from the opposition. This would greatly accelerate the PPP platform and transformation of Pakistan into the Islamic Socialist state it was always meant to be."
-Ensure a "super majority" (get event "PPP Wins Supermajority!"
-No need to get greedy (continues the electoral tree to "PAK_PPP_Victory")

PPP Wins Supermajority!
"Diplomatic Cable from American Ambassador to Pakistan: "I was invited to watch the electoral results with Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto at his residence. Once the tv broadcasts confirmed the PPP would win a majority, the room became jubilant and drinks were handed out to all attendees. However, within the hour, the mood of the Prime Minister soured. He saw results saying PPP candidates were winning seats by massive margins and were going to sweep a supermajority in parliament. The Prime Minister muttered curses and retired to his study where he was heard cursing his election cell leaders for being too zealous in ensuring the supermajority. He returned to the party but drank quietly and looked embarrassed as the results clearly indicate tampering had occurred during the electionâ€¦""
-Oh no (launches "Contested Election" event and opens that tree)

#PAK_Contested_Election

Contested Election 
"The 1977 General Elections have been marred in controversy. The election results, with suspicious margins of victory and the gain of so many seats to the PPP have galvanized the opposition and PNA. Many observers believe the PPP did win a majority, but its efforts at securing a complete victory backfired and brought the whole election into chaos. The PNA is leading massive protests, strikes, and unrest as they demand the government resign and new elections be held. Prime Minister Bhutto is criticizing the PNA for being embarrassed at their poor performance and is condemning them for undermining the nation just to gain political points. The PNA says it will maintain a boycott of the National Assembly and provincial assemblies until the government resigns and new elections are held under the supervision of the Supreme Court."
-Damn (gain spirits "Law and Order Crisis", "Street Protests", and "National Strikes")

Deploy the FSF? (event from PAK_Deploy_The_FSF)
"We established the Federal Security Force to have a paramilitary force loyal to the Prime Minister and answerable to his orders. Since its founding we have ensured the FSF receives all the weapons they demand and provide their personnel better perks than even the military. We have staffed their officers with loyalists and Army officers retired for not fitting in the institution. With the rise of unrest following the election results, the National Security Advisor suggests we deploy the FSF into the major cities to reduce the constant street protests. Some advisors fear deploying the FSF may only end up enflaming the protestors and backfire."
-Deploy the FSF (leads to either "FSF Restores Some Order) or "FSF Driven from Major Cities")
-No need

FSF Restore Some Order 
"The Federal Security Force battalions deployed to major cities have succeeded in reducing the street protests being organized by the opposition. Although the international press and those media outlets sympathetic to the opposition are criticizing the harshness of the crackdown, it has been a success. The FSF troops and their officers are carrying out their duties with zeal and dedication. The only concern we have heard is that Military Police units in the vicinity refused to offer any support to the FSF despite orders to aid in the restoration of law and order."
-Good (reduces impact of "Street Protests")

FSF Driven from Major Cities
"The Federal Security Force battalions deployed in major cities have been mostly driven out and forced back to their barracks. In many instances, when the FSF troops tried to break up the protestors, many more joined the streets and overwhelmed our troops. It appears our FSF forces were ill-prepared for street control and their officers often panicked. What is of more concern are rumors that when the FSF asked for backup from local police it did not materialize. When our officials reached out to local police for an explanation they were vague and we suspect the local military commanders threatened the police not to interfere."
-Damn (Increases impact of "Street Protests)

Activate the Rangers? (event from PAK_Rangers_Activated)
"The Pakistan Rangers are the largest paramilitary force in Punjab and Sindh. They are well-trained and equipped and officered by Pakistan Army officers. Our top security advisors believe the Rangers cannot be asked to crackdown on the opposition protestors. However, the public unrest has caused a spike in burglaries, robberies, and other crimes. Criminal groups are seizing the opportunity to run amok. The Prime Minister can ask the Interior Minister to order the Rangers to deploy. Some of the security advisors are urging we hold off calling on the Rangers as we cannot trust their officers will diligently carry out the orders."
-Activate the Rangers (highly likely "Rangers Ineffective" or "Rangers Crackdown on Gangs")
-No Need

Rangers Ineffective
"The Interior Minister ordered the Pakistan Rangers to deploy and aid law enforcement in cracking down on the spike in crimes. Although the Rangers have obeyed the order and established roadblocks, it appears they have not made a significant difference. Crime is still running amok and now we are hearing complaints that the government is completely inefficient at ending this new crime wave. It appears that the Army officers commanding Ranger units are putting very little effort in carrying out their orders. They are putting the appearance of obeying directives but doing nothing." 
-Damn (increases negative impact of "Law and Order Crisis")

Rangers Crackdown on Gangs
"The Interior Minister ordered the Pakistan Rangers to deploy and aid law enforcement in cracking down on the spike in crimes. The Rangers have carried out their orders diligently. Ranger troops have stormed suspected criminal hideouts and setup strategic checkpoints. This has resulted in a large number of arrests and confiscation of illegal weapons and drugs. Nearly a dozen illegal gambling dens have also been destroyed. The media is positively reporting on these actions and the crime wave is slowly subsiding. However, opposition papers are giving credit to the Army, not the government, regardless, increasing safety to citizens will help us in our efforts to restore orders."
-Good (Reduces impact of "Law and Order Crisis")

Open Negotiations? (event from PAK_Open_Negotiations)
"The PNA protests and the unrest that has resulted has caused immense difficulties for the government. The law and order situation in the country continues to deteriorated and there are fears internationally that Pakistan faces the risk of civil war. Our feelers indicate the PNA is open to holding talks. Although they have maintained pressure on the government, their coalition has always been precarious, with many different parties trying to work together. Their leadership feels a resolution is needed soon. The cabinet suggests the Prime Minister hold talks, however, some other advisors believe the government should just hold on and wait till the PNA efforts finally lose momentum."
-Hold talks (leads to either "Talks Make Progress" or "Talks Deteriorate"
-No need

Talks Make Progress
"Zulfikar Bhutto dispatched his close advisors to hold talks with the PNA leadership in order to find a solution to the unrest. The PNA is outraged over the recent election, claiming it was massively rigged in favor of the PPP. However, privately, the PNA understands that the PPP remains a popular party with powerful cadres across the country. They are willing to accept a proposal for fresh elections to be held under a temporary government of technocrats. The only issue is how soon to hold the elections. Although a final resolution has not been made, it appears the talks are on the right track and some of the rhetoric of PNA leaders has toned down in their rallies."
-Good (reduces negative impacts of "National Strikes")

Talks Deteriorate 
"Zulfikar Bhutto dispatched his close advisors to hold talks with the PNA leadership in order to find a solution to the unrest. The PNA is outraged over the recent election, claiming it was massively rigged in favor of the PPP. The talks however have largely stalled for several reasons. The PNA representatives are struggling to present a unified stance as it consists of multiple parties and interests. The PPP negotiators are not willing to concede their party would not have gained a majority without a majority. With the parties unable to even agree on a baseline, the talks are largely going nowhere. This has only agitated PNA leadership who have responded by escalating their rhetoric, especially to striking workers."
-Damn (increases negative impacts of "National Strikes")

Media Reports (event from PAK_Media_Reports)
"The Information Minister reported to Prime Minister Bhutto that his talks with representatives of the major newspapers were not encouraging. He emphasized to the papers that they had a role in aiding the government in curtailing the unrest. However, most of the publications insist they will only report on the news and are under no obligation to print reports favorable to the government. The only good news is that the media leadership also added that they are not particularly fond of some elements in the PNA and if there are any signs of positive changes, they will report on it fully as though they will not follow dictates from the government, they are aware of the dire situation facing the country."
-Things are spinning out of controlâ€¦ (leads to "Media Optimistic" if "Talks Make Progress" occurs or "Media Turn on Government" if "Talks Deteriorates" occrus)

Media Optimistic 
"Media reports in recent days have been largely positive. Insider sources from the PNA and PPP are both leaking information that recent talks were positive and a consensus appears on the horizon. With this news, the papers are also condemning lawlessness and especially divisive speeches by some of the more fringe PNA leaders. This is having a calming effect on the populous and there is a new sense of optimism in the air, which is refreshing. Prime Minister Bhutto has called his advisors together and insists they continue to push the country back towards reconciliation and stability."
-Things are looking up (decreases negative impacts of all three spirits)

Media Turn on Government
"Media reports in recent days have been largely negative. Insider sources, especially from the PNA have leaked news that talks held with the PPP are not going anywhere. This news has only increased the tensions in the country and has invigorated enemies of the government to criticize the PPP for seeking to turn Pakistan into a one party dictatorship. The Interior Minister has directed local authorities to confiscate and shutdown papers deemed to be inciting riots, but this is not being carried out fully. In addition, this has sparked new protests by those who claim the government is now enforcing censorship."
-Damn Dawn News (increases negative impacts of all three spirits)

Agreement on New Elections (if "Media Optimistic" and "Talks Make Progress" this fires) 
"Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto announced that after negotiations, the PPP and PNA have agreed on a solution to the contested election. Bhutto noted that he and his senior party leadership were not aware of any irregularities during the last election but noted their might have been issues at the polls by overzealous activists. He insisted the PPP had nothing to lose as they were the voice of the people and he looked forward to new elections. The PNA leadership held its own press conference and noted in three months new elections will be held and praised the people of Pakistan for their fight to restore democracy to the nation. Prime Minister Bhutto shortly thereafter resigned and handed power to a caretaker government of neutral technocrats to govern until elections are held. Many in the country welcome a return to normalcy."
-Excellent ("New Elections Held!" fires in 90 days, spirit "Caretaker Government" for 90 days, all spirits from "contested election" tree removed)

New Elections Held!
"After a vigorous three months of campaigning, the people of Pakistan are once again voting. The turnout is expected to be high as Pakistan must decide between the PPP and PNA. The PPP was accused of rigging the last election, however, its leadership has insisted the claims are overrated and for the sake of the nation they agreed to new elections. PPP leader Zulfikar Bhutto confidently informed reporters he had no hesitation in holding fresh elections as the PPP is the voice of the people. The PNA opposition leadership also expressed optimism, claiming it was them and the people who forced the PPP to restore democracy in the country. They campaigned on a promise for a more Islamic state that better reflects the desires of all Pakistanis, not just those in cities. Critics fear the PNA coalition maybe too unwieldly to govern, but they did lead the national protests against the last election results and are favored by many observers."
-PPP Win! (original PPP route for election fires and opens that tree, contested election tree ends before "Operation Fairplay")
-PNA Win! (original PNA route for election fires and opens that tree, contested election tree ends before "Operation Fairplay")

Operation Fair Play (event from PAK_Operation_Fair_Play)
"General Zia ul-Haq and his top generals launched an operation to remove Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto from power and institute martial law across Pakistan. Pakistanis in the capital and major cities woke up to find armed troops occupying key government buildings and surrounding the homes of senior government officials. General Zia himself met with Zulfikar Bhutto and insisted the measures were temporary and would only last until order could be restored. The now former Prime Minister is being taken to a villa located in a popular hill station for the time being. In an address to the nation, General Zia insisted the Army only acted to preserve the integrity and unity of Pakistan."
-Martial Law is necessary 

Bhutto Released (event from PAK_Bhutto_Released)
"With promises of fresh elections, the military government released former Prime Minister Bhutto, only after he promised to not undermine the regime and acknowledge he understood the coup was necessary. However, since his release, Bhutto has traveled across the country by railroad, addressing massive crowds. In his speeches he condemns the military coup and demands elections be held as soon as possible. He has also promised that when he returns to power, those who violated the constitution by supporting the coup will be punished. These speeches are agitating the masses and undermining General Zia as he tries to unite the country."
-Damn it (national spirit "Bhutto on the Rails" should effect stability, negatively effect economy)

Doctrine of Necessity Approved (event from PAK_Doctrine_Of_Necessity_Approved)
"In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court accepted the argument that General Zia ul-Haq had to launch his coup due to the doctrine of necessity. This ruling legitimizes the military takeover and will halt calls for military officers to be prosecuted for violating the constitution which specifically bans the overthrow of any elected government. Critics to the military regime, especially PPP leaders are condemning the ruling, claiming the justices are being unduly influenced by the military to rule in its favor. General Zia in his own statement welcomed the court ruling as proof of the legitimacy of his actions."
-Excellent (removes spirits related to the "contested elections tree")

Bhutto Charged with Murder! (event from PAK_Bhutto_Charged_With_Murder)
"The Martial Law regime formally brought charges against former Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto and arrested him. Ahmed Raza Kasuri accuses Bhutto of killing his father who died in a botched assassination attempt that Bhutto allegedly orchestrated. Bhutto denies the charges as politically motivated. The trial is expected to begin in a month at the Lahore High Court. The lawyers representing Bhutto noted there was no evidence beyond witness testimonies which are questionable at best. The government responded by saying the prosecution has a strong case and no one is above the law in Pakistan."
-So it begins (removes spirit "Bhutto on the Rails", in 30 days get event "Bhutto Trial Begins")

Bhutto Trial Begins
"The trial of Zulfikar Bhutto has begun. The former Prime Minister is accused of orchestrating an assassination attempt against the Kasuri family. Bhutto is said to be confidence as he has assembled a top rate legal tea. However, it is quickly apparent the judges appear biased against Bhutto as they continuously prevent defense objections and are allowing testimony from witnesses who recanted testimonies after being detained by military authorities. Bhutto is telling any who will listen that once he is out of prison again, he will punish those involved in these legal cases and General Zia. For his part, General Zia insists on making no statement and leaving the matter to the courts."
-Trial of the century (30 days later, "Court Reaches Verdict")

Court Reaches Verdict
"The Lahore High Court reached a verdict in the case of Zulfikar Bhutto. Bhutto was found not guilty in directly committing the attack on the Kasuri family, but due to his association to the plot, the court sentenced him to death. Almost immediately the defense lawyers of Bhutto condemned the decision and are appealing for the Pakistan Supreme Court to throw out the death sentence. Both the defense lawyers and international observers noted the trial appeared largely irregular and biased against Bhutto. The judges threw out evidence presented by the defense and emptied the court room when Bhutto asked to speak. Many Pakistanis believe General Zia ul-Haq and his military regime are influencing the trial behind the scenes. Angry crowds of PPP supporters took to the street in response. General Zia announced he will have to postpone planned elections until law and order can be ensured."
-Appealing to the Supreme Court (8 months later get event "Supreme Court Verdict", national verdict "Anger at Bhutto Verdict" negatively effecting stability/economy)

Supreme Court Verdict
"After nine months, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled to uphold the death sentence passed against Zulfikar Bhutto. The vote was passed 4-3 amidst accusations that the judges were being controlled by the military regime of General Zia ul-Haq. The attorneys for Bhutto note that many of the justices are directly connected to Zia. They also claimed the length it took for an appeal hearing was also a reflection of government interference. The military regime also issued a gag order on the rejoinder written by Bhutto against his charges. Finally, the Supreme Court took months to pick up the case with many Pakistanis believing the delay was due to most judges being in favor of acquittal. Only after Zia ensured enough judges would uphold the conviction, then he allowed the trial to continue. Despite the death sentence, the lawyers have filed fresh appeals and are calling on friends of Bhutto to demand the sentence at the very least be changed to a life in prison."
-Carry out the sentence (in six months get event "Bhutto Hanged")

Bhutto Hanged
"General Zia ul-Haq announced that he was a servant to the courts and his government carried out justice, following news that Zulfikar Bhutto was executed in Rawalpindi early in the morning. The execution took place despite the pleas of many international leaders and prominent Pakistani leaders. Nations like Saudi Arabia and Jordan promised to host Bhutto in exile. However, General Zia was unfazed and once the appeals were completed, the execution was carried out. Pakistan is said to be at a standstill, with most citizens stunned by the news that the charismatic leader of the popular PPP party is no more. Many PPP leaders have vowed revenge and several leading organizations condemned the action. However, analysts note that General Zia had long concluded that if he let Bhutto live, he risked his own life as Bhutto long promised to punish the generals who launched the coup and remained a popular national leader. Opposition for future elections are also low."
-It must be done (new spirit "International Pariah" all other spirits related to "contested election" removed, "Anger at Bhutto Verdict" removed, new three year spirit "Outrage over Bhutto Execution" negative impact on economy/stability)


#UPDATED WITH MISSING EVENTS 8/19/2021

Al-Zulfikar Promises Revenge
"The decision by the military to level charges against Zulfikar Bhutto has provoked young leftists, especially university students, to begin organizing into resistance cells. Many of these young people are escaping the cities for the hills of Baluchistan, to hide out among the historically independent tribal peoples. Although the resistance has not formally established a leadership structure, its supporters call themselves fighters for Al-Zulfikar. They demand the restoration of democracy and punishment for those who pervert it."
-Damn (gain spirit "Al-Zulfikar Insurgency" slight negative impact on construction, research, manpower growth, in five years get event "Al-Zulfikar Implodes")

Al-Zulfikar Implodes
"Supporters of the Al-Zulfikar movement confirmed the organization has essentially ceased to function. It appears there was a violent power struggle among senior leaders abroad. Many members, fearing reprisals, have chosen to return home. The Al-Zulfikar movement failed to develop a coherent message or expand its base beyond leftist university students. The organization did launch several attacks but failed to truly challenge the Pakistan military. Several attempts at launching large attacks on Pakistan military posts resulted in heavily losses for the rebels. Returning members blame Pakistan intelligence agencies for causing the recent leadership tensions by planting false rumors."
-There goes that (remove spirit "Al-Zulfikar Insurgency")
