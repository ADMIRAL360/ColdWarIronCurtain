-Something is better than nothing (just support equipment and trucks, a couple of research bonuses for mountain special forces, Pak-India ties hurt, Pak-India ties drop)

add_namespace = PAK_Kashmir_Unrest

Kashmir Unrest (fires from PAK_Kashmir_Unrest) this event provides background on the Kashmir tension
-Much to consider (player will then decide whether to go with the military option or diplomatic approach

#PAK_Upgrade_Radio_Free_Kashmir (when this focus is completed, should start event chain in India, will make those events here)

Pakistanis Hold Kashmir Solidarity Marches (PAK_Hold_Joint_Protests)
-Good to know (National spirit four years "Kashmir Solidarity" small morale boost for the military, increase in government popularity and stability)

Demand UN Action on Kashmir (PAK_Demand_UN_Action, will make small chain here but with new UN mechanics you might have a better way of doing this, should be available only after 360 days of upgrade radio free Kashmir focus is completed)

-End the talks (Pakistan gets "Talks With India End in Failure")

Kashmir Ceasefire Line Made Permanent (Pakistan Event)

-Sanctions reduced (Spirit "Sanctions over Kashmir" modified, now 10 percent drop in production/efficiency and 5 percent buildtime added to civ/mil/infra. The decision option on holding the plebiscite and ending the sanctions should again still be present

India Agrees to Plebiscite
-Peace in Kashmir? (India sanctions spirit removed, next event occurs 120 days later)

UN Forces Arrive at Ceasefire Line
-preparing phase 1 (45 days later, Pakistani withdrawal)

UN Oversees Pakistani Withdrawal
-On to phase II (Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan become demilitarized zones, 45 days later event "UN Oversees Indian Withdrawal", also a few days later this event should be triggered "Leave the Gilgit Scouts Behind?")

-Insist the Gilgit Scouts stay (if Kashmir votes to join India, the event "Pakistan Refuses to Vacate Gilgit Baltistan" launches for pakistan
-No need to risk the peaceplan (no change, if Kashmir joins India, Pakistan cannot get event "Pakistan Refuses to Vacate Gilgit Baltistan")

UN Oversees Indian Withdrawal

Kashmir Votes to Join Pakistan 
-Pakistan Zindabad (Kashmir territories ceded to Pakistan, if India kept the J&K Rifles in Kashmir, next event fires)

India: Refuses to Withdraw from Jammu?
-Seize Jammu (India gains control of Jammu) We can discuss the aftermath for this, either a new event chain or I can make a new tree
-We can do nothing (five year spirit, "Kashmir Abandoned" drop in stability, boost in popularity for right wing parties)

Kashmir Votes to Join India
-Kashmir United (Kashmir territories ceded to India, if Pakistan kept Gilgit Scouts in Kashmir, next event fires

Pakistan: Refuses to Vacate Gilgit Baltistan?
