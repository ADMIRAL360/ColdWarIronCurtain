#First General Election

Bangladesh First General Elections
“There is a sense of great excitement across Bangladesh as the people take to the polls. Many Bangladeshis view the elections as confirmation of their nation as the true vanguard of South Asian democracy. The Awami League is expected to triumph in the polls. With the results an almost foregone conclusion, the Awami League leadership faces a dilemma. It can rule independently, to fully implement its vision for the country. However, there are some within the party who advocate the formation of a national unity government, to bring all Bangladeshis in the political process. The Central Committee must make a decision on how to proceed.”
-Unity government (opens that branch after the election)
-The Awami League speaks for the people (opens that branch after the election)

The Islamic Academy Question
“In the late 1950s, two organizations formed to teach and spread awareness on Islamic practices in Dacca. In the years following, these organizations became the leading research institutions in the region on Islamic philosophy, culture, and knowledge. The government recently cracked down and banned the organizations for not supporting efforts at promoting Bangladesh independence. However, the people of Bangladesh increasingly want the organizations reinstated for spiritual guidance, leading to large protests. There is a proposal in parliament to merge the former groups into a government funded organization called the Islamic Foundation. The new organization would focus exclusively on spiritual matters and not intervene in politics. Some secularists argue such an organization goes against basic democratic principles and the government should maintain a ban.”
-Establish Islamic Foundation (greatly drops popularity of Islamic parties, slight drop in stability)
-Keep the groups banned (spirit “Islamic Suppression” increase civ factory demand, boost in religious parties)

New Constitution Amendments
“Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is currently governing the country based on the recent constitution, however, the government faces accusations of ignoring its provisions. There are efforts underway to pass new amendments that will legitimize some of the questionable actions by the government. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman wishes for the document to refocus on the core principles of nationalism, secularism, democracy, and socialism. Despite these lofty claims of expanding constitutional authority, the opposition accuses the government of creating a one-party state. Members of the ruling Awami League urge patience, noting the widespread problems currently facing the country.”
-It is for the best (drop in stability, boost to awami league popularity)

Land Reforms (event)
“The Bangladeshi peasant remains a victim of history, first by the pre-colonial feudal aristocracy and then by the colonial regime that empowered these zamindars. As such, much of the land remains underdeveloped or under the control of a small cabal. Socialism offers a path for the prosperity of the peasant. The cabinet has presented two programs of land reform, one calls for a moderate program of collectivization, while the other calls for a radical change. Some urge rapid action to transform society, but those supporting a moderate program note it may be better to ease society into socialism.”
-Moderate collectivization (5 year spirit “Small Scale Collectivization”, if possible, decrease output of agriculture but small boost to building new farms, in 8 months get “Collectivization Suffers Severe Setbacks”)
-Rapid collectivization (5 year spirit “Rapid Collectivization”, in six months “Collectivization Suffers Severe Setbacks”)

Collectivization Suffers Severe Setbacks
“The collectivization project we recently launched has hit major hurdles. Many peasants are refusing to give up their small holdings. More significantly, landlords are maintaining control by paying peasants to hold lands for them, defeating the purpose of the program. The civil service appears incapable of effectively identifying new lands to cultivate nor are government agents able to boost local production. We will have to scale back the collectivization program. On top of that, many peasants are infuriated with the government, the program has proven to be disastrous and agricultural production has dropped dramatically.”
-Damn (remove “Rapid Collectivization” with “Small Scale Collectivization” add spirit “Peasant Agitation”, six months later, get event “Bangladesh Faces Famine”)

Bangladesh Faces Famine
“Issues with the bureaucracy, weak rural authority, and problems with collectivization have caused severe food shortages. The current year shows a precipitous drop in agricultural productivity. There are already reports of starvation among peasant communities, with many fleeing to the cities. The cost of food is rising as well, fueling panic in the urban populations. Our own officials failed to keep the central government abreast with these issues and many ministries are struggling to respond. There are promises of international aid and support, but this will not come fast enough or in the quantities needed for our people. In a recent report to the cabinet, the Agricultural Minister noted the nation had entered a famine situation.”
-Damn (“Peasant Agitation” replaced with “Famine”, eight months later, the option for BAN_Respond_To_Famine should become available)

Respond to Famine
“The famine gripping Bangladesh is causing mass death but also hysteria on the streets. Politicians, landlords, and even the military are being accused of hoarding food stores from the general population. Peasants arriving to the city are desperate, police agencies report of violent protests and a rise in crime. The President has only one option. He must declare a humanitarian state of emergency to mobilize state resources and crackdown on hoarding by organized criminal elements. Once we stabilize the economy, the increasingly lawlessness and political disorder will also be addressed. Many in the Awami League recognize the opposition has recklessly sought to spread dangerous rumors for political gains.”
-It’s all we can do (replace famine with 5 year spirit “Managing Famine” which has same negative impacts of famine but much reduced)

Form BaKSAL?
“Bangladesh faces unprecedented challenges. The government continues to be attacked by the opposition, which does not hesitate to publish false news to enflame the population. If we are to implement our vision for the nation, some in the party suggest a radical solution. They want to push through a constitution amendment banning all political parties for national unity. The President can then declare a state of emergency and create a one-party state. We can then bring all political leaders under the President and carry out our agenda completely. However, this step maybe too radical, a decision must be made.”
-Pass the amendment (leads to event “Parliament Passes Amendment” in two weeks)
-It is too far (if selected, the Second General Election will eventually take place)

Parliament Passes Amendment
“The Parliament of Bangladesh narrowly passed a new amendment allowing the President to ban any political party during a state of emergency. Despite vehement protests from the opposition, who claim the new law is ripe for abuse, it was passed. The President states the bill will ensure an emergency situation can be handled efficiently. The reaction from the media has been mixed. Pro-government publications note the heightened political climate means such laws must be passed. The opposition press is arguing the bill lays the groundwork for a political takeover by the government.”
-We will see what happens (in six months, “President Announces State of Emergency”)

President Announces State of Emergency 
“In light of the increasingly unstable political environment, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced a state of emergency. Per his emergency powers, the President declared all political parties are to be banned. He stated his intentions to provide a meaningful solution to the political infighting in the country. The opposition leaders could not be reached for comment, most are under police protection. Although Mujibur Rahman promised to restore normalcy, many in the country are unsure what normalcy will mean.”
-A new era (national spirit “State of Emergency” (negative economic modifiers, drop in stability, 4 months later get event “Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Announce Establishment of BaKSAL”)

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Announce Establishment of BaKSAL
“President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced a new political party called the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League or BaKSAL. All politicians are required to join, including all sitting members of parliament. A new cabinet, consisting of members from all major political parties will govern the nation. Mujibur Rahman calls the new party as essential to establishing political harmony and unity. With the political leadership united, Bangladesh can finally embrace its destiny. Due to press censorships, it is unclear how the public is reacting. However, the foreign press notes a general, uneasy quietness among the people, indicating some discontent may be present.”
-Welcoming BaKSAL (removes “State of Emergency” replaces with “BaKSAL Government” drop in stability, economic stats)

Respond to Islamic Party Demands?
“The Islamic parties in Bangladesh, many with powerful grassroots organizations, are demanding the establishment of a ministry for Islamic affairs. They would like all legislation to be reviewed by this ministry to determine if it is compatible with Islam. This is of course unacceptable, Islam should be above politics. Instead, a compromise has been reached to establish an Islamic Academy to promote Islam and provide non-binding advice to the government when asked. However, even this is seen as unacceptable, especially to the more left wing elements of the Awami League. They advocate complete secularism.”
-Establish Islamic Foundation (greatly drops popularity of Islamic parties, slight drop in stability)
-Bangladesh is secular (spirit “Islamic Suppression” increase civ factory demand, boost in religious parties)

Respond to Leftist Demands?
“A group of leftist Awami League leaders, along with members of other left-wing parties have brought a demand on the government to greatly empower collective bargaining rights for workers. This is causing a stir as the Finance Ministry reports the decision may prove economically unwise, considering the current economic climate. Business leaders have also urged the government to not cave to such demands. However, it is clear from union leaders that a failure to implement the demand may provoke worker unrest. The government faces a difficult decision.”
-Support the workers (forced to accept a worker rights policy, in six months gain spirit “Happy Workers”)
-It is a step too far (gain 3 year spirit “Sporadic Worker Strikes”)

Happy Workers 
“The recent decision by the government to implement wider worker rights has borne some unexpected boosts. Reports indicate greater production and fewer incidents of worker unrest, which had been escalating in recent months. The government must take advantage of the stability in production and labor relations.”
-Great (3 year spirit “Happy Workers” production boost)

Discuss Land Reforms (event)
“The Awami League and its allies have long advocated a radical transformation of agriculture. They believe the colonial and post-colonial state maintained archaic modes of agriculture that hindered the development of peasants. For them, collectivization offers a solution to the crisis. The Awami League has proposed a modest collectivization program to not completely alienate the other parties in the coalition. The more conservative parties, however, believe such a step is too radical. They instead wish to institute a land reform which will allow the state to seize unproductive lands for redistribution to peasants. If collectivization is pushed through, the unity government maybe at risk.”
-Collectivization (5 year spirit “Small Scale Collectivization”, if possible, decrease output of agriculture but small boost to building new farms, in 8 months get “Collectivization Suffers Severe Setbacks”, in a couple weeks, get event “Unity Government Broken”)
-Seize unproductive lands (5 year spirit “Land Reform” boost to agricultural production, in six months get event “Land Reform Program Plagued With Corruption”)

Land Reform Program Plagued With Corruption
“The government recently launched a program to acquire arable land not being utilized from big landlords and redistributing it to peasants. The program enjoyed early success, however, it has begun to stall. The landlords are bribing local officials with impunity to ensure the land remains under their control through proxies. The government in Dacca appears uninterested or unable to stop these practices, undermining the whole program.”
-Oh no (3 year spirit “Rampant Corruption”, in two months get “Corruption Leads to Famine Situation”)

Corruption Leads to Famine Situation
“The failed land reform program has resulted in pushing Bangladesh into a famine. The unreliability of data has resulted in a much larger shortfall of agricultural objectives. The government appears unable to bring enough food from abroad to mitigate the situation. The increased scarcity of food is already leading to prices to go up in the markets. Many farmers are being accused of hording food, as are government officials. The situation is rapidly falling apart, the government will have to deal with this soon.”
-Oh no (gain spirit “Famine”)

Discuss Nationalization (event)
“Nationalization is a divisive issue in the parliament. The Awami League remains committed to widespread nationalization, however, many of the other parties urge a more gradual nationalization program. There is also widespread support for a more mixed economy of both private and nationalized industry. The government proposes an Industrial Nationalization Program based in Chittagong. However, the more conservative unity government members would prefer a more modest program to nationalize some essential industries. If the Industrial Nationalization Program goes through, there are worries the unity government may collapse.”
-Industrial Nationalization Program (that event chain starts, in a couple weeks, get event “Unity Government Broken”)
-Nationalize some essential industries (gain 2 factories, 3 year spirit “Nationalization” makes construction more expensive or could increase civ factory demand)

Question of Refugees (event)
“The question of settling refugees remains very pressing for the government. There are refugees who came during Partition and recently from Pakistan. Having them in camps is not a long-term solution, it erodes popular support for the government. One plan calls for these refugees to be placed in communities desperate for labor to produce new development projects. The other proposal is to settle refugees in commercial neighborhoods, especially markets to support that part of the economy.”
-Focus on boosting development (5 year spirit “Construction Labor Boost” makes production cheaper for infra
-Settle in Markets (add a financial building)

Respond to Leftist Violence (event)
“Many young leftists are increasingly critical of the government. They feel socialism is being neglected in the name of political compromises and the current party leadership is out of touch. Many want some of the more senior members to resign and give space to youth leaders. There are increasingly violent protests erupting in Dacca, with students demanding an end to the unity government and implement complete socialism to the country. The Awami League can appeal this group by promoting some of more left-wing leaders to senior positions within the party, though this would put a strain on the unity government, perhaps breaking it. The other option is to deploy the police to crackdown on these protests and try to force party discipline on the campuses.”
-Promote youth leaders (add 3 year spirit “Socialists Appeased” giving small stability boost, add popularity to Awami League, in two weeks get event “Unity Government Broken”) 

Unity Government Broken
“The Awami League led unity government has collapsed. The coalition partners claim the Awami League is not governing by consensus. The move comes after a series of disagreements with regards to recent legislation. Coalition partners claim the Awami League is seeking to push through radical legislation. Although the unity government has collapsed, the Awami League will continue to govern as it holds the majority of seats. The government released a statement, noting it had formed the unity government out for the sake of national unity but the opposition now wishes to play politics as Bangladesh faces a critical juncture.”
-Oh no (remove spirit “Unity Government”)

Discuss Foreign Policy (event)
“Foreign policy is of critical concern for the government. Those with a strong attachment to the colonial period and the early Pakistan movement support, a push to strengthening ties with the West. They see Bangladeshi democracy and economy being intrinsically linked with those ties. The socialist and left leaning people wish to focus on improving ties with the socialist world. They believe the future of Bangladesh lies in creating a socialist society. Finally, there are many who feel much of the problems facing Bangladesh comes from foreign influence, they wish to focus on ties with neighbors and regional powers.”
-Orient to the west (trade/relations boost with US/France/UK)
-The future is with the socialists (trade/relations boost with East Germany/USSR/China)
-Focus close to home (trade/relations boost with India/Burma/Sri Lanka)

Responding to Famine (event)
“The famine gripping Bangladesh is causing mass death but also hysteria on the streets. Politicians, landlords, and even the military are being accused of hoarding food stores from the general population. Peasants arriving to the city are desperate, police agencies report of violent protests and a rise in crime. The President has only one option. He must declare a humanitarian state of emergency to mobilize state resources and crackdown on hoarding by organized criminal elements. Once we stabilize the economy, the increasingly lawlessness and political disorder will also be addressed. Many in the Awami League recognize the opposition has recklessly sought to spread dangerous rumors for political gains, despite efforts by the party to govern in unity.”
-It’s all we can do (replace famine with 5 year spirit “Managing Famine” which has same negative impacts of famine but much reduced)

Empower BakSAL?
“The nation faces unprecedented challenges, socially, politically, and economically. The current famine has revealed the limitations of the unity government. If we are to bring the Awami League vision for the nation, some in the party suggest a radical solution. They want to push through a constitution amendment banning all political parties to promote true national unity. The President can then declare a state of emergency and create a one-party state. We can then bring all political leaders under the President and carry out our agenda completely. However, this step maybe too radical, a decision must be made.”
-Pass the amendment (leads to event “Parliament Passes Amendment” in two weeks, essentially follow the event chain as previously established)
-It is too far (if selected, the Second General Election will eventually take place)

Instead, we will offer these Pakistanis a fair compensation, and then liquidate these assets to the people of Bangladesh."
Reduce Foreign Dependence (Description)
"Our people have long been used as a source of exploitation by foreign powers. As such, the economy is structured to facilitate this draining of national wealth abroad.

The government will bring these officials back to the civil service. Appointments will be based on qualification and experience, not political allegiance."
Strengthen Local Police Forces (description)
"The overly centralized style of governance by the previous regime meant local institutions were declining rapidly. This gave way to a rise in criminal activity, especially in the countryside. This heavily hindered the internal movement of goods and services. The government will initiate a new program to pump funds to local police units and re-introduce pre-independence officers who had been forced into early retirement."
Deploy Troops in the Countryside (description)

Empower Local Councils (description)

Investigate Suspected Officers (description)
"The President understands the previous period of political instability was driven by military officers deeply engaged with politics. Chain of command was often ignored and politicians could call on specific units to protect them. The military is launching an extensive investigation to identify, dismiss, or reform, any personnel found to be engaged in politics or anti-state ideologies. Chain of command must be restored."
Restore Army Discipline (description)
"Military officers of various ranks have been involving themselves in politics and unsanctioned violence. In some units commanding officers are powerless in the face of politically connected subordinates. This situation is intolerable, President Ziaur has ordered a thorough crackdown on insubordination from top to bottom."
Support Bangladesh Nationalism (description)
"The Awami League and others advocated a cultural, Bengali nationalism. However, this leaves out the Biharis and other minorities in the country. Instead, the country should embrace a new nationalism based on a Bangladeshi identity, not an exclusively Bengali one."
Re-Islamisation of Bangladesh (description)
"The traditional Islamic greeting, the call to prayer, and invocation of Islam when starting official government events will become standard practice. The nation remains secular, however, the previous governments were promoting a secularism at the expense of the Islamic identity of Bangladeshis. This will no longer be tolerated."
Establish Gram Sarkar (description)

Government initiatives meant to lift rural people will also be more effectively carried out on the village level."
Establish Village Defence Party (description)
"With the success of the Gram Sarkar system, a new Village Defence Party system is being implemented. This will allow the local councils to control, direct, and fund village police/self-defence patrols. The new reform will strengthen security in the villages and finally curb the lawlessness of rural Bangladesh."
Youth Workshops  (description)

Population Planning (description)
"The leading economists in the country note our high birthrate is the greatest threat to sustainable, economic growth.

Establish BJR Research Institute (description)

Codify Central Committees (description)
"The Central Committee finalized its rules, regulations, and powers. They have been bound and released to the public.

Confiscate Excess Wealth (description)

With a devotion to the nation, the people will be eager to make the sacrifices for the national cause."
National Bank Reform (description)

(as noted, once this is complete, depending on player’s choice in previous tree, either constitution a or constitution b event launches)
Awami League Government (description)
"Despite calls for a unity government, the people overwhelmingly support the agenda of the Awami League. It would not be fair to deny the people their choice just to ease the ego of the opposition. The Awami League will bring socialism, secularism, and prosperity to the people."
Form the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini (description)
"Bangladesh faces unprecedented security challenges, especially in rural areas. Armed bands and corrupt officials run rampant.

Rehabilitate Displaced Bengalis (description)

Approach Pakistan for Final Status (description)
"With the new constitution in force, elections, and a partition of responsibilities, the stage is set for a final decision on the Pakistan Federation. The President of Pakistan is set to meet with the senior East Pakistani leadership. The discussions are expected to last at least two weeks.

Pro-federation supporters hope East Pakistan can once again go under federal rule but with a degree of autonomy."
