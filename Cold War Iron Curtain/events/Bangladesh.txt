#Assassination of Ziaur Rahman Chain
add_namespace = Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination

Major Party Conflict in Chittagong (Fires several months after Ziaur Rahman chain completed)
Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.1.d:0 "President Ziaur Rahman received reports that his local party officials in Chittagong are suffering from intense political infighting. The situation is deteriorating rapidly, and his presence is requested to negotiate a compromise. Moving quickly, the President has left Dacca. He plans on staying near the Army cantonment for the next few days to resolve the matter. Maintaining party discipline and unity in Chittagong is crucial for the governing of the country. Before leaving the capital, the President assured his top officials that the matter will be resolved in a matter of days."
-Will have to restore order (leads to "Army Officers Storm Circuit Hotel" in a couple days)

Army Officers Storm Circuit Hotel
Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.2.d:0 "President Ziaur Rahman is dead. A group of commissioned officers, armed with submachine guns, rocket launchers, and grenades stormed the Circuit Hotel where the President was staying while on a visit to Chittagong. The assassins avoided dealing with a frontal assault, blowing up two holes in the rear of the Circuit Hotel. Before the main force of Presidential Guards could arrive, the assassins had managed to capture Ziaur Rahman before executing him at close range. Two of the assassins were killed as they escaped, one identified as a colonel. General Abul Manzoor, the Chittagong commander, took to the local radio, calling on the nation to unite and create a real nation. It appears a coup is afoot."
-The President is dead! (leads to "General Ershad Orders Rebel to Surrender")

General Ershad Orders Rebel to Surrender
Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.3.d:0 "Fears of a coup in Bangladesh over the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman have dissipated. The serving Army Chief, General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, quickly took charge of the situation. He went on the radio and called on all rebel forces to surrender and the arrest of General Abul Manzoor. The response has effectively isolated Chittagong and the rebel leaders from the rest of the nation. The swift response by General Ershad has rallied all other major garrisons to pledge their loyalty to the government and Army hierarchy. There are reports of unrest among the troops in Chittagong over both the assassination and radio broadcasts."
-Order restored (lead to "Coup Leader Killed")

Coup Leader Killed
Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.4.d:0 "General Abul Manzur, viewed as the mastermind behind the assassination of the late President Ziaur Rahman, was reported to have been killed, effectively ending his rebellion. Following demands by the Army Chief for Manzur and his forces to surrender, half the Chittagong garrison switched their loyalty back to the government. With the situation turned against him, General Manzur reportedly surrendered to loyalist troops without incident. However, within several hours, he was reported to be killed. Rumors are circulating that an angry group of loyalist soldiers surrounded and killed the rebel commander out of anger. Although many in the country feel justice was done, there are some rumors suggesting Manzur was killed to silence him from revealing the involvement of more senior military and civilian leaders to the coup attempt."
-Justice (leads to "Funeral for President Rahman")

Funeral for President Rahman
Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.5.d:0 "A couple million Bangladeshis attended the funeral of the late President Ziaur Rahman in Dacca. The crowd was grief stricken, with many expressing great sorrow for the late leader. Despite his reputation as a strong-man, many felt President Rahman brought a firm hand the nation needed. His campaigns for promoting nationalism and economic stability will be a lasting memory. As the funeral ends, many in the country will be looking nervously to the future. Vice President Abdus Sattar was sworn in to assume the presidency. The seasoned elder statesman promised to continue the policies of Ziaur Rahman and hold fresh elections in the near future."
-A moving event (leads to "President Abdus Sattar Wins Election" in six months)

President Abdus Sattar Wins Election
Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.6.d:0 "Acting President Abdus Sattar, who took over following the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman, easily won the recent presidential election. Many Bangladeshis view the election results as confirmation the country remains committed to the legacy of Ziaur Rahman. President Sattar thanked the supporters of the BNP and called for a new era of development for the nation. He also revealed a vision for increasing the cooperation of national institutions. Despite the victory, there are concerns over the health and age of Sattar."
-Democracy triumphs (in two months, event "General Ershad Assumes Power" in 4 months)

General Ershad Assumes Power
Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.7.d:0 "General Hussain Muhammad Ershad has assumed the post of President and Chief Martial Law Administrator. Over the previous hours, the President and Vice President both resigned. General Ershad dissolved the parliament and announced hundreds of politicians will be arrested for corruption. The military claims it had to act following the inefficiencies of the current government. General Ershad insists that if he had not acted, anti-state forces would have plunged Bangladesh into chaos. Analysts are not surprised by the coup as the President and Army Chief had been engaged in political bickering over the past few months. A recent decision to remove military officers from administrative posts is seen as the last draw. Bangladeshis look towards an uncertain future."
-A new era (Ershad Tree opens in the 80s)


FOCUS DESCS
Mixed Economy Growth (description)
"The recent economic initiatives have set Bangladesh on a path of a true mixed economy. We will gain the benefits of both a free market and socialist economy. Providing the potential of growth while also preserving the people from exploitation. Balancing our economy is the key for the stable economic growth of Bangladesh."
Seize Pakistan Assets (Description)
"A number of private Pakistani corporations and businessmen continue to hold assets. These carpetbaggers have long drained our wealth to their bank accounts in Lahore. We will seize these assets in the name of the people."
-5 year spirit "Seized Pakistan Assets" should lower consumer good demand
Expand Worker Rights (Description)
"The previous regime and the British colonial state long suppressed the rights of workers in our land. The time to rectify this is now. The government will recognize unions and legalize the right to strike."
-5 year spirit "Expanded Worker Rights" increase in stability, increase in consumer good demand
Restore Rural Order (Description)
"The advent of independence revealed chaos in the countryside. Local administrators and police abandoned their post. The government must re-establish police stations and a sense of security to the people."
Invite Pakistan to Liquidate Assets (description)
"Pakistani nationals still possess a number of assets across Bangladesh. It is a legacy of the exploitation our people faced. Although it is well within our rights to seize these assets, to do so would risk weakening our international standing and hurt foreign investment. Instead, we will offer these Pakistanis a fair compensation, and then liquidate these assets to the people of Bangladesh."
Reduce Foreign Dependence (Description)
"Our people have long been used as a source of exploitation by foreign powers. As such, the economy is structured to facilitate this draining of national wealth abroad. The government will initiate a series of tariffs and ban certain imports to spur the emergence of a national economy." (leads to spirit "Tariffs and Protections" should give boost to infra/factory construction but also increase the costs)
Transitioning to Mixed Economy (description)
"Our five year plan has successfully put Bangladesh on the path of economic independence and equality. The exploitive elements of our economy are being removed while the foundation for a new economy of socialism and equality is laid out."
Modernize Water Distribution (Description)
"The government announced a new initiative to modernize water distribution across rural areas of the country. The old infrastructure is now decades old and in need of an upgrade. The effort is being widely praised as an example of state institutions cooperating for the betterment of the people."
Remove AL Members From Civil Service (description)
"Die-hard Awami League members, many lacking the proper qualifications or training, were appointed to key civil service posts. In order to restore order and reduce corruption, these Awami League members must be removed."
Rehabilitate Former Bureaucrats (description)
"The previous government removed those civil servants trained in the colonial or Pakistan period. Often replacing them with political appointees who lacked proper qualifications. The government will bring these officials back to the civil service. Appointments will be based on qualification and experience, not political allegiance."
Strengthen Local Police Forces (description)
