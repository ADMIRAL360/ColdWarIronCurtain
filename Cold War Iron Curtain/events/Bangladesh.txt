#Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad Regime

Army Reform
"There is increased tension within the military. The professional officers, trained during the colonial and Pakistan period continue to assert themselves as the most elite officers in the military. The freedom fighters and youth wing fighters from before independence were integrated into the military after independence. Those promoted to officers are complaining the professional officers marginalize them, preventing their promotions. The professional officers are demanding we support their policy of converting the integrated elements into their vision for the Army. The former freedom fighters advocate the establishment of a more national, peoples army. The President must decide which faction to back."
-Support professional officers (New spirit "Professional Army" drop in recruitment, increased morale/organization)
-We need a peoples army (new spirit "Peoples Army" boost in recruitment, reduced training time, drop in morale/organization)

Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad Praises Officers (event, praising killers of Mujibur Rahman)
"President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad praised the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a recent speech. He called the assassins sons of the sun for their actions. He claimed had the officers not acted, the government and nation faced the risk of total collapse. In his concluding remarks, he called for the nation to come together and ended his speech with Bangladesh Zindabad. Notably changing the previous slogan from Joy Bangla. The remarks are being received with a reaction of surprise and anger. Many Bangladeshis are now convinced their new leader was involved in the assassination. Loyalists to the late Mujibur Rahman are said to be infuriated by the remarks."
-Interesting (Increases negative impact of Awami League Sympathizers, reduces negative impact of Political Instability)

Reduce Indian Presence 
"There is an increased fear among Bangladeshis that India enjoys too many privileges and influence in the country. This feeling is especially prevalent among the officer corps. The government will implement a new foreign policy to reduce Indian influence on the country. We will increase restrictions on border crossings, call for India to reduce its diplomatic missions, and implement more trade restrictions. We leaked some news ahead of time and the public seems to agree with this new direction in policy. The Indians must know they cannot infringe on our sovereignty."
-A new era (if any military access agreements with India, these are cancelled, drop in trade ties/relations with India)

Begin Reversing Economic Nationalization
"The cabinet noted the previous policy of nationalizing the economy had occurred far too rapidly in the country. It stated support for a society where workers, the nation, and economy could all flourish together. However, expert reports confirmed the state lacked the capacity to effectively run all the industries it had nationalized. As such, the cabinet decided on a program to privatize a percentage of government industries. The government hopes this will spur spending and drive dynamic growth in the economy. Several unions and Awami League officials expressed concern over the decision. However, for many Bangladeshis suffering in a stagnant economy, they are willing to try anything for growth."
-A new era (reduce negative impact of economic stagnation, three year spirit "Privatization Spurs Production Boom")

#KM Shafiullah Regime

Arrest Mujib Killers
"General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, met with his senior military commanders to discuss the fate of those who killed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. One group of officers believe a public trial should occur in which the brutal details of the assassination can be understood by the population. Then the killers can be executed to provide justice to the whole nation. However, another group of officers worry such a trial could lead to backlash against the military as a whole. Instead, they argue the killers should be tried in a private court martial, to minimize anti-military rhetoric and show the nation how the military deals with traitors. President Shafiullah must make a difficult decision."
-Arrange public trials (in six months lead to "Public Trial of Mujib Assassins Concludes"
-Arrange private court martials  "Court Martial Set to Release Rulings"

Public Trial of Mujib Assassins Concludes
"The public trial of those military officers involved in the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ended today. The nation was stunned to hear how a group of mid-level officers armed themselves, stormed the Rahman residence, and butchered him, along with his family. Only by not being in the country were his two daughters spared. The prosecution hinted that senior military officers may have privately facilitated the coup, however, the government already announced there would be no other trials. The eight assassins, including three majors, all claimed they acted to save the nation from corruption and dictatorship. The verdict will be announced in a few days, with many expecting a guilty verdict followed by an execution."
-The public awaits (Awami League gain popularity, in a couple days "Killers Sentenced to Death")

Court Martial Set to Release Rulings 
"The Bangladesh military announced its court martial would soon release the verdict of the eight men involved in assassinating the late President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Details of the trial were kept from the general public. The military claimed the case was under military jurisdiction and it would see justice be done. Though there was some initial public discontent over the privacy in the case, many Bangladeshis eagerly await to hear the ruling. The civil lawyers for the accused were not allowed to participate in the court martial and have called the trial a sham. The trial is also being viewed with suspicion from the media in India."
-The public awaits (leads to "Military Executes Killers")

Killers Sentenced to Death
"The assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were sentenced to death in court yesterday. The eight men will be hanged in the coming days. Thousands of Awami League supporters took the streets to celebrate this justice for their late leader. The court was not persuaded by the assassins argument that they killed the President to prevent a dictatorship and save the nation. General K.M. Shafiullah, the current President, welcomed the court decision. Three Army majors are among the convicted. Although the government and Awami League welcome the news, there are reports of unrest within the military and among more conservative circles. They believe the accused are being scapegoated and painted in a way to malign the military and other conservative political parties. Many military officers believed the removal of Mujibur Rahman was justified considering his political actions and closeness to India."
-Justice (5 year spirit "Military Discontent")

Military Executes Killers
"The military announced the verdict of its court-martial, all eight involved in assassinating Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were sentenced to death. The military added the executions by hanging were already carried out. The news caught many in the country off-guard. A large Awami League rally in honor of the late Mujibur Rahman was hastily organized. Many in the country were critical of the military trial due to its secretive nature, but welcomed the verdict. Within the military, there are some who feel the court made the accused scapegoats. These officers feel the assassination was justified due to the political instability plaguing the nation. The government released a statement welcoming the news and confirming there would be no other trials connected to the assassination. For many Bangladeshis, the incident is resolved, at least for now."
-Justice (3 year spirit "Military Discontent")

Integrate MB to Army?
"Officers and soldiers who joined the national army from the pre-independence resistance movement known as the Mukti Bahini complain of being isolated in the military. They claim the pre-independence soldiers and officers, all professionally trained, systematically ensure the MB personnel do not receive promotions or attractive postings. The President must decide whether to allow the Army to remain dominated by the professional military class, or insist on a true integration of the forces. Supporting the professional military class would keep the military structure as is, with the MB personnel eventually being retired out of service. Backing the MB personnel will push the military towards a more peoples army organization."
-Support professional officers (New spirit "Professional Army" drop in recruitment, increased morale/organization)
-We need a peoples army (new spirit "Peoples Army" boost in recruitment, reduced training time, drop in morale/organization)

Crush Marxists
"Since taking power, General K.M. Shafiullah has worked tirelessly to identify and neutralize threats to the state. The more militant conservative elements were largely neutralized even before he took power. However, Marxists have long been engaged in violent acts and the hostile infiltration of both the government and military. In response to this threat, General Shafiullah recently ordered a mass crackdown of dangerous Marxist organizations across the nation. Security forces have detained government, military, and public officials identified as pro-Marxist. In addition, a number of student leaders and rural agitators were also detained. In remarks to the nation, General Shafiullah noted socialism is a means towards economic emancipation, however, Marxism represents a threat to the religion and culture of Bangladeshis."
-Remove the threat (reduces negative impact of political instability and economic stagnation)

Announce New Elections
"General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, announced new elections will be held in the near future. The respected war hero noted his regime was restoring stability. Across both society and state institutions. The leader did not give a specific date on when elections would be held but stated crime and corruption must be further reduced for an election to be possible. He added that following the election, he would retire from the military, having accomplished his duty to the nation and the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. All political parties will be allowed to participate and campaign openly. The announcement was well-received across Bangladesh. The Awami League appears ready to start its campaigning while the opposition parties are expected to form a coalition to oppose them. Although there is no firm date on elections, the people are satisfied with the present course of the nation."
-Excellent (spirit "Shafiullah Restoring Order" boost to stability, removes spirits political instability and awami league sympathizers, new elections would be in the 80s tree)


FOCUS DESCS
Mixed Economy Growth (description)
"The recent economic initiatives have set Bangladesh on a path of a true mixed economy. We will gain the benefits of both a free market and socialist economy. Providing the potential of growth while also preserving the people from exploitation. Balancing our economy is the key for the stable economic growth of Bangladesh."
Seize Pakistan Assets (Description)
"A number of private Pakistani corporations and businessmen continue to hold assets. These carpetbaggers have long drained our wealth to their bank accounts in Lahore. We will seize these assets in the name of the people."
-5 year spirit "Seized Pakistan Assets" should lower consumer good demand
Expand Worker Rights (Description)
"The previous regime and the British colonial state long suppressed the rights of workers in our land. The time to rectify this is now. The government will recognize unions and legalize the right to strike."
-5 year spirit "Expanded Worker Rights" increase in stability, increase in consumer good demand
Restore Rural Order (Description)
"The advent of independence revealed chaos in the countryside. Local administrators and police abandoned their post. The government must re-establish police stations and a sense of security to the people."
Invite Pakistan to Liquidate Assets (description)
"Pakistani nationals still possess a number of assets across Bangladesh. It is a legacy of the exploitation our people faced. Although it is well within our rights to seize these assets, to do so would risk weakening our international standing and hurt foreign investment. Instead, we will offer these Pakistanis a fair compensation, and then liquidate these assets to the people of Bangladesh."
Reduce Foreign Dependence (Description)
"Our people have long been used as a source of exploitation by foreign powers. As such, the economy is structured to facilitate this draining of national wealth abroad. The government will initiate a series of tariffs and ban certain imports to spur the emergence of a national economy." (leads to spirit "Tariffs and Protections" should give boost to infra/factory construction but also increase the costs)
Transitioning to Mixed Economy (description)
"Our five year plan has successfully put Bangladesh on the path of economic independence and equality. The exploitive elements of our economy are being removed while the foundation for a new economy of socialism and equality is laid out."
Modernize Water Distribution (Description)
"The government announced a new initiative to modernize water distribution across rural areas of the country. The old infrastructure is now decades old and in need of an upgrade. The effort is being widely praised as an example of state institutions cooperating for the betterment of the people."
Remove AL Members From Civil Service (description)
"Die-hard Awami League members, many lacking the proper qualifications or training, were appointed to key civil service posts. In order to restore order and reduce corruption, these Awami League members must be removed."
Rehabilitate Former Bureaucrats (description)
"The previous government removed those civil servants trained in the colonial or Pakistan period. Often replacing them with political appointees who lacked proper qualifications. The government will bring these officials back to the civil service. Appointments will be based on qualification and experience, not political allegiance."
Strengthen Local Police Forces (description)
"The overly centralized style of governance by the previous regime meant local institutions were declining rapidly. This gave way to a rise in criminal activity, especially in the countryside. This heavily hindered the internal movement of goods and services. The government will initiate a new program to pump funds to local police units and re-introduce pre-independence officers who had been forced into early retirement."
Deploy Troops in the Countryside (description)
"The centralized style of rule from the previous government meant very little resources were available to the rural areas, especially the police. As such, smuggling, violence, and robbery are a major problem. To tackle this issue, the government will deploy Army troops from cantonments to bolster the local police and restore order."
Empower Local Councils (description)
"The government announced plans to give extensive powers to Local Councils established across rural areas of the country. Many villages complained the previous, centralized system moved too slowly, unable to react effectively to important issues. The Local Councils will ensure effective governance by local people trusted in the villages."
Investigate Suspected Officers (description)
"The President understands the previous period of political instability was driven by military officers deeply engaged with politics. Chain of command was often ignored and politicians could call on specific units to protect them. The military is launching an extensive investigation to identify, dismiss, or reform, any personnel found to be engaged in politics or anti-state ideologies. Chain of command must be restored."
Restore Army Discipline (description)
"Military officers of various ranks have been involving themselves in politics and unsanctioned violence. In some units commanding officers are powerless in the face of politically connected subordinates. This situation is intolerable, President Ziaur has ordered a thorough crackdown on insubordination from top to bottom."
Support Bangladesh Nationalism (description)
"The Awami League and others advocated a cultural, Bengali nationalism. However, this leaves out the Biharis and other minorities in the country. Instead, the country should embrace a new nationalism based on a Bangladeshi identity, not an exclusively Bengali one."
Re-Islamisation of Bangladesh (description)
"The traditional Islamic greeting, the call to prayer, and invocation of Islam when starting official government events will become standard practice. The nation remains secular, however, the previous governments were promoting a secularism at the expense of the Islamic identity of Bangladeshis. This will no longer be tolerated."
Establish Gram Sarkar (description)
"The new self-government village system called Gram Sarkar will give local authorities a much wider breadth of government power. This will expand democracy on the grassroots level to the people. Government initiatives meant to lift rural people will also be more effectively carried out on the village level."
Establish Village Defence Party (description)
"With the success of the Gram Sarkar system, a new Village Defence Party system is being implemented. This will allow the local councils to control, direct, and fund village police/self-defence patrols. The new reform will strengthen security in the villages and finally curb the lawlessness of rural Bangladesh."
Youth Workshops  (description)
"The Awami League and its youth wing spent years fostering ties with university and secondary school students. President Ziaur wishes to harness this youth power away from partisan politics. The government will organize Youth Workshops across the country for young people to learn and promote Bangladeshi nationalism."
Population Planning (description)
"The leading economists in the country note our high birthrate is the greatest threat to sustainable, economic growth. The economy will eventually be completely unable to match its growth with the increase in population. To combat this issue, a new national campaign, targeting communities with high birthrates, will educate the population on the benefits of family planning."
Establish BJR Research Institute (description)
"The President opened the Bangladesh Jute and Rice Institute. This new facility, the first of several planned, will improve agricultural research and planning for the nation. Top researchers and officials will study at the institute and be able to implement experiments to improve the agricultural sector of the economy."
New Infrastructure Program (description)
"A healthy national economy relies on the fast, efficient movement of goods across domestic markets. The government announced a new focus and funding initiative to support the construction of new infrastructure projects to better connect all the people of Bangladesh."
Reverse Collectivization (description)
"The first government sought to implement agricultural collectivization. However, the practice was alien to our peasants and saw a major drop in production. The President announced plans to end collectivization schemes across the country and return farms to the producers."
Expand Rural Electrification (description)
"The rural areas have been neglected by the state since the Mughals ruled the land. Yet these peasants make the backbone of our economy. To aid their lives and offer more opportunities, the government announced the opening of new power plants meant to provide electricity to neglected communities."
Ban All Political Parties (description)
"The JSD Central Committee confirmed a ban on all political parties in Bangladesh. It noted the state must be supreme and undivided by partisan politics. All political offices are directed to shutdown and all materials for non-JSD political parties are to be confiscated for destruction."
Complete Secularization (description)
"The government announced a ban on the use of any Islamic phrasing on government materials, media broadcasts, or by party officials addressing the population. The JSD claims it is not suppressing Islam, but simply establishing the conditions of a secular state, as envisioned by the founders of Bangladesh. Grassroot Muslim community leaders are said to be infuriated by this change of policy."
Codify Central Committees (description)
"The Central Committee finalized its rules, regulations, and powers. They have been bound and released to the public. The decision to write down and release the procedures of the Central Committee are meant to provide the public confidence in their leaders. Critics claim the JSD operates with impunity, but the written records of state organs prove those critics wrong."
Formalize Rural Militias (description)
"The rural militias formed to protect the people from criminal elements and corrupt government officials are to be formalized as part of the military. The military are to incorporate these forces when necessary and provide them with access to weapons and facilities. Some military officers are complaining the militias are not compatible, but those officers will soon be brought in to be educated on the merits of our plan."
Expand Collectivization (description)
"Agriculture remains a critical component of the economy. Our people were long victims of landlords and colonial exploitation. To make the land fertile and break the feudal class, the government announced a new plan to expand collectivization across the country. This will help bring the early end to the feudal landlord classes."
Confiscate Excess Wealth (description)
"The elite landlord classes along with urban capitalists have spent centuries working with enemies of the people to steal the wealth of the nation for themselves. This will no longer be the case. Banks are directed to confiscate funds from individuals who have wealth far beyond what is necessary.
