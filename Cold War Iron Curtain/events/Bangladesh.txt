#Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (event chain launches if BakSAL formed, JSD insurgency still on, and the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini formed)
add_namespace = Rahman_Assasination

Army Officers Swarm Residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
Rahman_Assasination.1.d:0 "There is chaos in Dacca following reports that armed, uniformed men stormed the residence of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. There are reports of explosions and gunfire from the residence. Bangladeshis are said to be in a state of apprehension as they try to understand what is occurring. The recent uptake in violence, crime, and an economic crisis has greatly eroded the popularity of the President. The military in particular is said to the perturbed by these crises as it finds itself engaged in a conflict with the radical socialist JSD."

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Family Assassinated
Rahman_Assasination.2.d:0 "State media in Bangladesh confirmed that patriotic military officers were responsible for the assault on the residence of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The officers then went on the air to confirm they had killed Mujibur Rahman to save the nation. Among the confirmed dead are his two sons, who were seen as his future successors. His two daughters are in West Germany. Just several years earlier, millions cheered Mujibur Rahman as their champion, however, the reaction to his death is largely subdued. It appears the economic crisis and other domestic issues have largely depleted his standing among the people. It is unclear exactly who is now in charge of the government. The military continues to remain silent on their roll in this coup. The officers involved are of mid-level ranks and the higher ranked officers appear to be just as shocked by the coup as the people."

Khondaker Mostaq Khan Takes Over Presidency
Rahman_Assasination.3.d:0 "In an unprecedented development, Khondaker Mostaq Khan has proclaimed himself the new President of Bangladesh. He is a noted nationalist leader and member of the executive committee. The new leader appeared to have taken over with support from the coup leaders. Analysts believe the coup plotters believed their low ranks made them vulnerable but the new President will legitimize their action. The new President did work with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Prior to joining the executive committee, he had served as a minister for the government. Some experts believe his selection as President is meant to appease the armed wing of the Awami League and prevent either a counter-coup or foreign intervention. The people of Bangladesh are left waiting to see what the future holds for them."

Respond to Assassination (couple of weeks after assassination)
Rahman_Assasination.4.d:0 "President Khondaker Mostaq Khan took over as President after being approached by the Awami League leadership following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The new present must now decide what to do with the assassins. It is clear the assassins approved his appointment on the condition he grant them immunity. If this is not given, there is a high possibility of another, more violent coup by the heavily armed, junior officers. The other option is to take no opinion on the assassination and defer it to the military justice system. This decision will determine the destiny of the new government."
-Grant immunity (leads to event "New President Announces Indemnity Ordinance")
-Defer to Military (will be a factor if his tree gets activated)

New President Announces Indemnity Ordinance
Rahman_Assasination.5.d:0 "President Khondaker Mostaq Khan addressed the nation. He praised the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for saving the nation from destruction. He also called for national reconciliation. As part of this plan, he announced a new Indemnity Ordinance. This will give full immunity to the assassins, who are already receiving senior positions in the new government. Many Bangladeshis are said to be shocked by the decision, though there are no reports of unrest. However, the Awami League and its most die hard members will be infuriated over the lack of justice for their late leader. There are already rumors in Dacca that the new President faces a high risk of an Awami League reaction, as many wish to see Mujibur Rahman avenged."
-To heal the nation (check 1 for counter-coup)

A New Army Chief?
Rahman_Assasination.6.d:0 "If the regime of President Khondaker Mostaq Khan is to survive, the military must be brought under control. The initial coup had been launched by mid level officers, but they lack the authority or status to assert control over the military. The current Army Chief, General Shafiullah was a strong supporter of Mujibur Rahman and did not see the coup coming. If he is retained, it may maintain order, but puts the government at risk considering his political views. Many officials are recommending General Shafiullah be retired and replaced by General Ziaur Rahman. General Rahman is seen as a conservative officer, not likely to be influenced by the Mujibur Rahman loyalists. However, his is an ambitious officer, promoting him may give the military more influene over the state."
-Keep General Shafiullah (if kept, would play a part in potential counter-coup
-Promote Genearl Ziaur Rahman (retire Sahfiullah)

Dismantle BakSAL
Rahman_Assasination.7.d:0 "The late President Mujibur Rahman sought to consolidate his power through his BakSAL party. President Khondaker Mostaq Khan announced he would immediately breakup BakSAL and allow all political parties to return. He noted the one-state party left many Bangladeshis to feel disenfranchised or uninvolved with the politics of the country. Restoring political parties will bring back the rich political activism of the people and restore a more democratic character to Bangladesh. The move is being widely praised, though there are some concerns. Many politicians fear the religious parties may take advantage of this new situation and try to manipulate the electorate by playing on religious sentiments. The President dismissed these concerns and noted his belief in the compatibility of Islam and democracy."

Consolidate Power? (3 Months after previous evens)
Rahman_Assasination.8.d:0 "Following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the ascension of President Khondaker Mostaq Khan to office, senior Awami League leaders were detained. The new President recognized his position was very precarious with regards not only to the military officers who carried out the assassination but to Mujibur loyalists in the party. These loyalists, though detained, still wield tremendous influence and could potentially stir a violent response from the militant wing of the Awami Party. Some senior officials are recommending the President should remove these Awami League opponents, before they either escape from prison or are released. They could easily rally a hostile opposition to the government. Other advisors believe this may backfire, they urge reconciliation. Releasing the political prisoners could buy good will. A decision must be made."
-Remove Awami League Opponents (if Indemnity Ordinance passed, this will lead to counter-coup three days later, either "General Khaled Mosharaf Acts" or "General Shafiullah Acts". If IO not passed, no counter coup, will start Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed Regime Tree (ending the chain) and launch a new 5 year spirit "Strong Awami League Opposition" greatly weakening the political power and economy)
-Release political prisoners (if Indemnity Ordinance not passed, will start Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad Regime Tree (ending the chain))

General Khaled Mosharaf Acts
Rahman_Assasination.9.d:0 "General Khaled Mosharaf, a highly decorated, senior Bangladeshi officer, working with pro-Mujibur Rahman military units, seized control of the government overnight. General Khaled Mosharaf, outraged by the assassination and protection of the assassins acted following reports that senior Awami League officials were killed in prison under suspicious circumstances. The current Army Chief, senior government officials, including President Khondaker Mostaq Khan and the assassins of Mujibur Rahman are either in detention or house arrest. In an address to the nation, Khaled Mosharaf promised to bring the killers of Mujibur Rahman to justice and restore chain of command in the military. Within hours of the announcement, thousands marched to commemorate Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, no longer fearing reprisals from the government. General Mosharaf has claimed the position of Army Chief and President."
-The Assassins are Overthrown (removes Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed, Khaled Mosharaf is in charge, three days later, "Colonel Abu Taher Launches Coup")

Colonel Abu Taher Organizes Mutiny
Rahman_Assasination.10.d:0 "The chaos in Bangladesh continues following reports of a mutiny by soldiers opposed to the coup of General Khaled Mosharaf. The mutiny is being led by left-wing soldiers and officers, being directed by retired Colonel and JSD leader Abu Taher. The mutineers are arresting, killing, attacking officers loyal to General Mosharaf or the late Mujibur Rahman. Apparently, many of the mutinying soldiers believe the new leader is an Indian agent, bent on surrendering Bangladesh to India. Although Mosharaf claimed the title Army Chief from General Ziaur Rahman, the claim is not being recognized within the ranks. There are reports of intense fighting across the capital and around the home where Ziaur Rahman is currently being held. Time will tell what will happen."
-End the revolt! (leads to "Ziaur Rahman Freed, Mosharaf Assassinated")

Ziaur Rahman Freed, Mosharaf Assassinated
Rahman_Assasination.11.d:0 "Hours after reports of a leftist, military uprising, the situation in Bangladesh has changed again. General Khaled Mosharaf, who only days earlier overthrew the government, was killed during a counter-coup launched by revolting soldiers. General Ziaur Rahman, was released from his house arrest and has taken control of the government, reclaiming his title as Army Chief. Acting swiftly, General Zia ordered the immediate restoration of discipline and chain of command. Pro-Mosharaf officers and soldiers are under detention. All remaining political prisoners held by either the late General Mosharaf or the former President Khondaker Mostaq Khan are to be released or shifted to house arrest until a decision can be made. The leftist soldiers who released Zia were seeking a new socialist government, however, General Zia declared he will take over the situation without a socialist government or junta."
-Long live Zia? (leads to "General Ziaur Rahman Restores Order" in a few weeks)

General Ziaur Rahman Restores Order
Rahman_Assasination.12.d:0 "In the weeks following both a coup and counter-coup, General Ziaur Rahman has firmly restored order in the country and within the military. Officers and soldiers involved in both coup plots are being swiftly detained. Most notably, the retired Colonel Abu Taher, who influenced the coup which facilitated his release from house arrest was also detained. General Zia noted the uprising against General Mosharaf sought not to restore order but bring a socialist military state into power. If discipline is to be restored, all these movements must be stamped out of the barracks. In addition to restoring order in the military, General Zia has overseen an extensive deployment of security forces to lower lawlessness and restore order across the country. Many Bangladeshis are welcoming a new sense of calm and order being brought by the new regime."
-His tree gets active, ending this chain, in six months event "Colonel Taher Hanged" fires)

Colonel Taher Hanged
Rahman_Assasination.13.d:0 "A military tribunal convicted Colonel Abu Taher to hang for his crimes of treason and murder. The former JSD leader is accused of overseeing anti-state activities during the insurgency period. He was also accused of arranging the assassination of General Khaled Mosharaf and other officers loyal to him to facilitate a brutal socialist takeover of Bangladesh. His execution does not bode well for his own supporters within the Army, as many assumed they would enjoy immunity as their actions helped facilitate the return of General Zia to power. However, General Zia recognizes the influence of outside ideologies and personalities were crippling the discipline and order within the Army. His mass detention and trials of prominent military officers involved in recent coups are meant to restore discipline in the barracks."
-Justice

General Shafiullah Acts (Fires instead of General Khaled Mosharaf Acts as the counter-coup if he is still kept as Army Chief)
Rahman_Assasination.14.d:0 "General K.M. Shafiullah, the Army Chief of Bangladesh, and popular war hero, has overthrown President Khondaker Mostaq Khan. The General acted following reports that several Awami League members died under mysterious circumstances in prison. For General Shafiullah, this was the last draw. A prominent Mujibur Rahman supporter, he had been shocked by his assassination but helped keep the nation together in the aftermath. However, the failure of President Mostaq Khan to bring the assassins to justice and the recent suspicious jailhouse killings made the situation intolerable for the general and his senior officers. Bangladeshi troops are out on the streets. In an address to the nation, the new leader promised justice for the late Mujibur Rahman and stability for a nation rocked by instability."

Colonel Abu Taher Launches Revolt
Rahman_Assasination.15.d:0 "Retired Colonel Abu Taher, a former leader in the JSD, organized a Marxist uprising from junior officers and soldiers loyal to the vision of a socialist revolution. The leftist soldiers rapidly moved to seize control of major formations and assassinate General K.M. Shafiullah. There are reports of sporadic fighting across military cantonments in the country. The residence of the Army Chief is also said to be a scene of intense firing. It appears Colonel Taher is seeking to take advantage of the current instability in the country in order to establish a revolutionary socialist state. The coming hours will reveal any changes to the situation on the ground."
-Destroy the mutineers! (leads to "General Shafiullah Restores Order")

General Shafiullah Restores Order
Rahman_Assasination.16.d:0 "The leftist counter-coup against General K.M. Shafiullah has collapsed in disorder. The popular Army Chief was able to rally his supporters and issue commands rapidly during the violence. His own loyal troops were able to halt an assassination team from targeting the general at his home. Thousands of rebel soldiers, officers, and civilian sympathizers are under detention. They are expected to face trial. Colonel Abu Taher, who organized the attempt, was killed during the fighting. Addressing the nation, General Shafiullah praised the armed forces for remaining steadfast in their duty to the nation. With his rule firmly consolidated, he can now focus on restoring the revolution, as envisioned by the late Mujibur Rahman."
-Now to restore the Revolution (opens the "Shafiullah Regime" tree, ends this chain)

#Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad Regime

Army Reform
"There is increased tension within the military. The professional officers, trained during the colonial and Pakistan period continue to assert themselves as the most elite officers in the military. The freedom fighters and youth wing fighters from before independence were integrated into the military after independence. Those promoted to officers are complaining the professional officers marginalize them, preventing their promotions. The professional officers are demanding we support their policy of converting the integrated elements into their vision for the Army. The former freedom fighters advocate the establishment of a more national, peoples army. The President must decide which faction to back."
-Support professional officers (New spirit "Professional Army" drop in recruitment, increased morale/organization)
-We need a peoples army (new spirit "Peoples Army" boost in recruitment, reduced training time, drop in morale/organization)

Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad Praises Officers (event, praising killers of Mujibur Rahman)
"President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad praised the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a recent speech. He called the assassins sons of the sun for their actions. He claimed had the officers not acted, the government and nation faced the risk of total collapse. In his concluding remarks, he called for the nation to come together and ended his speech with Bangladesh Zindabad. Notably changing the previous slogan from Joy Bangla. The remarks are being received with a reaction of surprise and anger. Many Bangladeshis are now convinced their new leader was involved in the assassination. Loyalists to the late Mujibur Rahman are said to be infuriated by the remarks."
-Interesting (Increases negative impact of Awami League Sympathizers, reduces negative impact of Political Instability)

Reduce Indian Presence 
"There is an increased fear among Bangladeshis that India enjoys too many privileges and influence in the country. This feeling is especially prevalent among the officer corps. The government will implement a new foreign policy to reduce Indian influence on the country. We will increase restrictions on border crossings, call for India to reduce its diplomatic missions, and implement more trade restrictions. We leaked some news ahead of time and the public seems to agree with this new direction in policy. The Indians must know they cannot infringe on our sovereignty."
-A new era (if any military access agreements with India, these are cancelled, drop in trade ties/relations with India)

Begin Reversing Economic Nationalization
"The cabinet noted the previous policy of nationalizing the economy had occurred far too rapidly in the country. It stated support for a society where workers, the nation, and economy could all flourish together. However, expert reports confirmed the state lacked the capacity to effectively run all the industries it had nationalized. As such, the cabinet decided on a program to privatize a percentage of government industries. The government hopes this will spur spending and drive dynamic growth in the economy. Several unions and Awami League officials expressed concern over the decision. However, for many Bangladeshis suffering in a stagnant economy, they are willing to try anything for growth."
-A new era (reduce negative impact of economic stagnation, three year spirit "Privatization Spurs Production Boom")

#KM Shafiullah Regime

Arrest Mujib Killers
“General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, met with his senior military commanders to discuss the fate of those who killed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. One group of officers believe a public trial should occur in which the brutal details of the assassination can be understood by the population. Then the killers can be executed to provide justice to the whole nation. However, another group of officers worry such a trial could lead to backlash against the military as a whole. Instead, they argue the killers should be tried in a private court martial, to minimize anti-military rhetoric and show the nation how the military deals with traitors. President Shafiullah must make a difficult decision.”
-Arrange public trials (in six months lead to “Public Trial of Mujib Assassins Concludes”
-Arrange private court martials  “Court Martial Set to Release Rulings”

Public Trial of Mujib Assassins Concludes
“The public trial of those military officers involved in the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ended today. The nation was stunned to hear how a group of mid-level officers armed themselves, stormed the Rahman residence, and butchered him, along with his family. Only by not being in the country were his two daughters spared. The prosecution hinted that senior military officers may have privately facilitated the coup, however, the government already announced there would be no other trials. The eight assassins, including three majors, all claimed they acted to save the nation from corruption and dictatorship. The verdict will be announced in a few days, with many expecting a guilty verdict followed by an execution.”
-The public awaits (Awami League gain popularity, in a couple days “Killers Sentenced to Death”)

Court Martial Set to Release Rulings 
“The Bangladesh military announced its court martial would soon release the verdict of the eight men involved in assassinating the late President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Details of the trial were kept from the general public. The military claimed the case was under military jurisdiction and it would see justice be done. Though there was some initial public discontent over the privacy in the case, many Bangladeshis eagerly await to hear the ruling. The civil lawyers for the accused were not allowed to participate in the court martial and have called the trial a sham. The trial is also being viewed with suspicion from the media in India.”
-The public awaits (leads to “Military Executes Killers”)

Killers Sentenced to Death
“The assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were sentenced to death in court yesterday. The eight men will be hanged in the coming days. Thousands of Awami League supporters took the streets to celebrate this justice for their late leader. The court was not persuaded by the assassins argument that they killed the President to prevent a dictatorship and save the nation. General K.M. Shafiullah, the current President, welcomed the court decision. Three Army majors are among the convicted. Although the government and Awami League welcome the news, there are reports of unrest within the military and among more conservative circles. They believe the accused are being scapegoated and painted in a way to malign the military and other conservative political parties. Many military officers believed the removal of Mujibur Rahman was justified considering his political actions and closeness to India.”
-Justice (5 year spirit “Military Discontent”)

Military Executes Killers
“The military announced the verdict of its court-martial, all eight involved in assassinating Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were sentenced to death. The military added the executions by hanging were already carried out. The news caught many in the country off-guard. A large Awami League rally in honor of the late Mujibur Rahman was hastily organized. Many in the country were critical of the military trial due to its secretive nature, but welcomed the verdict. Within the military, there are some who feel the court made the accused scapegoats. These officers feel the assassination was justified due to the political instability plaguing the nation. The government released a statement welcoming the news and confirming there would be no other trials connected to the assassination. For many Bangladeshis, the incident is resolved, at least for now.”
-Justice (3 year spirit “Military Discontent”)

Integrate MB to Army?
“Officers and soldiers who joined the national army from the pre-independence resistance movement known as the Mukti Bahini complain of being isolated in the military. They claim the pre-independence soldiers and officers, all professionally trained, systematically ensure the MB personnel do not receive promotions or attractive postings. The President must decide whether to allow the Army to remain dominated by the professional military class, or insist on a true integration of the forces. Supporting the professional military class would keep the military structure as is, with the MB personnel eventually being retired out of service. Backing the MB personnel will push the military towards a more peoples army organization.”
-Support professional officers (New spirit “Professional Army” drop in recruitment, increased morale/organization)
-We need a peoples army (new spirit “Peoples Army” boost in recruitment, reduced training time, drop in morale/organization)

Crush Marxists
“Since taking power, General K.M. Shafiullah has worked tirelessly to identify and neutralize threats to the state. The more militant conservative elements were largely neutralized even before he took power. However, Marxists have long been engaged in violent acts and the hostile infiltration of both the government and military. In response to this threat, General Shafiullah recently ordered a mass crackdown of dangerous Marxist organizations across the nation. Security forces have detained government, military, and public officials identified as pro-Marxist. In addition, a number of student leaders and rural agitators were also detained. In remarks to the nation, General Shafiullah noted socialism is a means towards economic emancipation, however, Marxism represents a threat to the religion and culture of Bangladeshis.”
-Remove the threat (reduces negative impact of political instability and economic stagnation)

Announce New Elections
“General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, announced new elections will be held in the near future. The respected war hero noted his regime was restoring stability. Across both society and state institutions. The leader did not give a specific date on when elections would be held but stated crime and corruption must be further reduced for an election to be possible. He added that following the election, he would retire from the military, having accomplished his duty to the nation and the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. All political parties will be allowed to participate and campaign openly. The announcement was well-received across Bangladesh. The Awami League appears ready to start its campaigning while the opposition parties are expected to form a coalition to oppose them. Although there is no firm date on elections, the people are satisfied with the present course of the nation.”
-Excellent (spirit “Shafiullah Restoring Order” boost to stability, removes spirits political instability and awami league sympathizers, new elections would be in the 80s tree)


FOCUS DESCS
Mixed Economy Growth (description)
"The recent economic initiatives have set Bangladesh on a path of a true mixed economy. We will gain the benefits of both a free market and socialist economy. Providing the potential of growth while also preserving the people from exploitation. Balancing our economy is the key for the stable economic growth of Bangladesh."
Seize Pakistan Assets (Description)
"A number of private Pakistani corporations and businessmen continue to hold assets. These carpetbaggers have long drained our wealth to their bank accounts in Lahore. We will seize these assets in the name of the people."
-5 year spirit "Seized Pakistan Assets" should lower consumer good demand
Expand Worker Rights (Description)
"The previous regime and the British colonial state long suppressed the rights of workers in our land. The time to rectify this is now. The government will recognize unions and legalize the right to strike."
-5 year spirit "Expanded Worker Rights" increase in stability, increase in consumer good demand
Restore Rural Order (Description)
"The advent of independence revealed chaos in the countryside. Local administrators and police abandoned their post. The government must re-establish police stations and a sense of security to the people."
Invite Pakistan to Liquidate Assets (description)
"Pakistani nationals still possess a number of assets across Bangladesh. It is a legacy of the exploitation our people faced. Although it is well within our rights to seize these assets, to do so would risk weakening our international standing and hurt foreign investment. Instead, we will offer these Pakistanis a fair compensation, and then liquidate these assets to the people of Bangladesh."
Reduce Foreign Dependence (Description)
"Our people have long been used as a source of exploitation by foreign powers. As such, the economy is structured to facilitate this draining of national wealth abroad. The government will initiate a series of tariffs and ban certain imports to spur the emergence of a national economy." (leads to spirit "Tariffs and Protections" should give boost to infra/factory construction but also increase the costs)
Transitioning to Mixed Economy (description)
"Our five year plan has successfully put Bangladesh on the path of economic independence and equality. The exploitive elements of our economy are being removed while the foundation for a new economy of socialism and equality is laid out."
Modernize Water Distribution (Description)
"The government announced a new initiative to modernize water distribution across rural areas of the country. The old infrastructure is now decades old and in need of an upgrade. The effort is being widely praised as an example of state institutions cooperating for the betterment of the people."
Remove AL Members From Civil Service (description)
"Die-hard Awami League members, many lacking the proper qualifications or training, were appointed to key civil service posts. In order to restore order and reduce corruption, these Awami League members must be removed."
Rehabilitate Former Bureaucrats (description)
"The previous government removed those civil servants trained in the colonial or Pakistan period. Often replacing them with political appointees who lacked proper qualifications. The government will bring these officials back to the civil service. Appointments will be based on qualification and experience, not political allegiance."
Strengthen Local Police Forces (description)
"The overly centralized style of governance by the previous regime meant local institutions were declining rapidly. This gave way to a rise in criminal activity, especially in the countryside. This heavily hindered the internal movement of goods and services. The government will initiate a new program to pump funds to local police units and re-introduce pre-independence officers who had been forced into early retirement."
Deploy Troops in the Countryside (description)
"The centralized style of rule from the previous government meant very little resources were available to the rural areas, especially the police. As such, smuggling, violence, and robbery are a major problem. To tackle this issue, the government will deploy Army troops from cantonments to bolster the local police and restore order."
Empower Local Councils (description)
"The government announced plans to give extensive powers to Local Councils established across rural areas of the country. Many villages complained the previous, centralized system moved too slowly, unable to react effectively to important issues. The Local Councils will ensure effective governance by local people trusted in the villages."
Investigate Suspected Officers (description)
"The President understands the previous period of political instability was driven by military officers deeply engaged with politics. Chain of command was often ignored and politicians could call on specific units to protect them. The military is launching an extensive investigation to identify, dismiss, or reform, any personnel found to be engaged in politics or anti-state ideologies. Chain of command must be restored."
Restore Army Discipline (description)
"Military officers of various ranks have been involving themselves in politics and unsanctioned violence. In some units commanding officers are powerless in the face of politically connected subordinates. This situation is intolerable, President Zia has ordered a thorough crackdown on insubordination from top to bottom."
Support Bangladesh Nationalism (description)
"The Awami League and others advocated a cultural, Bengali nationalism. However, this leaves out the Biharis and other minorities in the country. Instead, the country should embrace a new nationalism based on a Bangladeshi identity, not an exclusively Bengali one."
Re-Islamisation of Bangladesh (description)
"The traditional Islamic greeting, the call to prayer, and invocation of Islam when starting official government events will become standard practice. The nation remains secular, however, the previous governments were promoting a secularism at the expense of the Islamic identity of Bangladeshis. This will no longer be tolerated."
Establish Gram Sarkar (description)
"The new self-government village system called Gram Sarkar will give local authorities a much wider breadth of government power. This will expand democracy on the grassroots level to the people. Government initiatives meant to lift rural people will also be more effectively carried out on the village level."
Establish Village Defence Party (description)
"With the success of the Gram Sarkar system, a new Village Defence Party system is being implemented. This will allow the local councils to control, direct, and fund village police/self-defence patrols. The new reform will strengthen security in the villages and finally curb the lawlessness of rural Bangladesh."
Youth Workshops  (description)
"The Awami League and its youth wing spent years fostering ties with university and secondary school students. President Zia wishes to harness this youth power away from partisan politics. The government will organize Youth Workshops across the country for young people to learn and promote Bangladeshi nationalism."
Population Planning (description)
"The leading economists in the country note our high birthrate is the greatest threat to sustainable, economic growth. The economy will eventually be completely unable to match its growth with the increase in population. To combat this issue, a new national campaign, targeting communities with high birthrates, will educate the population on the benefits of family planning."
Establish BJR Research Institute (description)
"The President opened the Bangladesh Jute and Rice Institute. This new facility, the first of several planned, will improve agricultural research and planning for the nation.

Reverse Collectivization (description)
"The first government sought to implement agricultural collectivization. However, the practice was alien to our peasants and saw a major drop in production. The President announced plans to end collectivization schemes across the country and return farms to the producers."
Expand Rural Electrification (description)
"The rural areas have been neglected by the state since the Mughals ruled the land. Yet these peasants make the backbone of our economy. To aid their lives and offer more opportunities, the government announced the opening of new power plants meant to provide electricity to neglected communities."
Ban All Political Parties (description)
"The JSD Central Committee confirmed a ban on all political parties in Bangladesh. It noted the state must be supreme and undivided by partisan politics. All political offices are directed to shutdown and all materials for non-JSD political parties are to be confiscated for destruction."
Complete Secularization (description)

The JSD claims it is not suppressing Islam, but simply establishing the conditions of a secular state, as envisioned by the founders of Bangladesh. Grassroot Muslim community leaders are said to be infuriated by this change of policy."
Codify Central Committees (description)
"The Central Committee finalized its rules, regulations, and powers. They have been bound and released to the public. The decision to write down and release the procedures of the Central Committee are meant to provide the public confidence in their leaders. Critics claim the JSD operates with impunity, but the written records of state organs prove those critics wrong."
Formalize Rural Militias (description)
"The rural militias formed to protect the people from criminal elements and corrupt government officials are to be formalized as part of the military. The military are to incorporate these forces when necessary and provide them with access to weapons and facilities. Some military officers are complaining the militias are not compatible, but those officers will soon be brought in to be educated on the merits of our plan."
Expand Collectivization (description)

To make the land fertile and break the feudal class, the government announced a new plan to expand collectivization across the country. This will help bring the early end to the feudal landlord classes."
Confiscate Excess Wealth (description)
"The elite landlord classes along with urban capitalists have spent centuries working with enemies of the people to steal the wealth of the nation for themselves. This will no longer be the case. Banks are directed to confiscate funds from individuals who have wealth far beyond what is necessary. For those holding excessive properties, they will be forced to hand much of that income to the state."
Urban Infrastructure Project (description)
"The Urban Development Project Phase I is nearing completion. It will provide strong urban infrastructure improvements, to better prepare the nation for an industrial revolution. The project highlights how strong the nation is when it comes together."

Bengali Cultural Programs (description)
"Colonialism and the early post-colonial period saw the continued, sustained assault on the language, literature, and art of Bengalis. The government will launch an extensive program to teach the people their heritage and foster patriotism. With a devotion to the nation, the people will be eager to make the sacrifices for the national cause."
National Bank Reform (description)
"Private banks remain a bane to the existence of so many Bangladeshi workers. Our own state banks are often too focused on macro-economic issues. A series of new reforms will expand the number of government banks and focus on providing support for the people."
Empower Local Governments (description)

All of Pakistan anxiously awaits to see what type of autonomy and government the people wish." (as noted, once this is complete, depending on player’s choice in previous tree, either constitution a or constitution b event launches)
Awami League Government (description)
"Despite calls for a unity government, the people overwhelmingly support the agenda of the Awami League. It would not be fair to deny the people their choice just to ease the ego of the opposition. The Awami League will bring socialism, secularism, and prosperity to the people."
Form the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini (description)
"Bangladesh faces unprecedented security challenges, especially in rural areas. Armed bands and corrupt officials run rampant. To solve the issue a new force called the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini has formed. It will become a paramilitary force to target violent groups and support law enforcement. The military is said to be angered as resources and manpower will be diverted from it to arm the group."
Rehabilitate Displaced Bengalis (description)

Compulsory Islamic Education (description)

To save future generations, the Education Ministry announced plans to make Islamic Studies a compulsory class for all Bangladeshi children."
Approach Pakistan for Final Status (description)
"With the new constitution in force, elections, and a partition of responsibilities, the stage is set for a final decision on the Pakistan Federation. The President of Pakistan is set to meet with the senior East Pakistani leadership. The discussions are expected to last at least two weeks. The main issue will be how to integrate the new changes in East Pakistan with the federal government.

Pro-federation supporters hope East Pakistan can once again go under federal rule but with a degree of autonomy."
Rural Banking Reform (description)
