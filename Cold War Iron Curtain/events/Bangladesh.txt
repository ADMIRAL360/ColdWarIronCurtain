Announce New Elections
Shafiullah.8.d:0 "General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, announced new elections will be held in the near future. The respected war hero noted his regime was restoring stability. Across both society and state institutions. The leader did not give a specific date on when elections would be held but stated crime and corruption must be further reduced for an election to be possible. He added that following the election, he would retire from the military, having accomplished his duty to the nation and the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. All political parties will be allowed to participate and campaign openly. The announcement was well-received across Bangladesh. The Awami League appears ready to start its campaigning while the opposition parties are expected to form a coalition to oppose them. Although there is no firm date on elections, the people are satisfied with the present course of the nation."
-Excellent (spirit "Shafiullah Restoring Order" boost to stability, removes spirits political instability and awami league sympathizers, new elections would be in the 80s tree)


#Ziaur Rahman Regime

Ziaur Rahman Promises Politics of Hope
“General Ziaur Rahman, Chief Martial Law Administrator Bangladesh gave a stirring address to the nation. He noted the people had overcome great adversity in recent years, with many divided along political, religious, and class lines. Zia declared the time had come for healing and stability. He then promised the people a politics of hope, built on looking to the future, not the past. Built not on tearing down or attacking opponents, but on national unity and peaceful development. He promised elections once the situation has stabilized. The comments are being well-received by a beleaguered Bangladeshi population eager for peace and stability.”
-Excellent (in one year, “Presidential Elections Held”)

Presidential Elections Held
“The people of Bangladesh took to the polls to elect a new President. The Chief Martial Law Administrator, General Ziaur Rahman won in a landslide. This is a major victory for his new political party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which helped rally popular support during the election campaign. Although General Zia was quick to thank the voters for providing him such a landslide, international observers did note there were irregularities. Despite these reports on the integrity of the vote, many Bangladeshis appear to have welcomed the result. The Awami League released a statement criticizing the voting process.”
-5 more years (create new party, Bangladesh Nationalist Party, with majority popularity, in a few days, event “Sheikh Hassina Wishes to Return”)

Sheikh Hasina Wishes to Return (fires a year after Presidential Election)
“Sheikh Hasina, daughter of the assassinated President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has requested permission to return. She and her sister were abroad when rouge military officers butchered their family. The Awami League recognizes Sheikh Hasina as the heir of Mujibur Rahman and previous governments refused her permission to return. For President Zia, her return will provide a major boost to the Awami League. However, to deny her return could spark unrest and cause people to question his own integrity, as he promised the people he would focus on the future, not the past. Permission was ultimately granted, allowing Sheikh Hasina to return home to take on the role her father held for so many years.”
-The Return (decrease negative impact of “Awami League Sympathizers”, Sheikh Hasina leader of Awami League, Awami League gains boost in popularity)

Codify Indemnity Act
“President Ziaur Rahman approved a new constitutional amendment adding the Indemnity Act to the constitution. The Indemnity Act had been passed to grant immunity to the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. President Zia insisted his decision is meant to heal the nation and move away from a politics of revenge or grievances. The Awami League and supporters of the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman condemned the amendment. They accuse the President of siding with the assassins and protecting his own political allies who may have been involved behind the scenes. Some publications went so far as to accuse President Zia of passing the amendment to stop any investigation of his own role in the assassination. The President also confirmed the legalization of conservative and religious parties originally banned by the Awami League.”
-A time of for forgiveness (brings in Jamaati Islami and Bangladesh Muslim League, increase negative impact of Awami League Sympathizers)

Privatization Campaign 
“President Ziaur Rahman recognizes the popularity and benefits socialism has had the economy. Certain state industries remain popular in the minds of the people. However, the economy remains weak and a new approach must be tested. The government announced it will freeze any further nationalization, opening several underperforming industries for privatization. In addition, a series of new policies meant to promote private sector growth was initiated. The government hopes shifting towards a more market economy can spur growth and naturally reduce nationalization.”

Food For Work Program (event)
“Historically, twice a year, before harvest, Bangladeshi farmers face the risk of starvation. Food availability during this period is low as are economic opportunities. Many famines and starvations have occurred during this time. President Ziaur Rahman unveiled a new Food for Work Program to end the cycle of starvation. Under the program, Bangladeshi farmers, during these lean periods, will be employed to work on government infrastructure programs in exchange for food. The food provided will save these families and prevent mass starvation. The government believes in addition to providing a public service to the people, the program will strengthen the economy by ensuring agricultural stability all year long.”
-Triumphant program (national spirit “Food for Work” boost in infra production, increase stability, boost in agricultural production)

Expand Chinese Ties
“There is increased concern, especially among military officers over our reliance on Indian support. The government is under pressure to find an alternative source for military equipment to prevent India from achieving hegemonic influence. China has the equipment, technology, and is geographically close to us. The Foreign Minister is making a trip soon and could request the Chinese provide support for the Bangladesh Army. Others in the cabinet believe shifting to China could lead to an over-correction, giving them too much influence over time, they request we simply use the trip to boost existing ties.”
-Keep in cordial (end chain, Chinese-Bangladesh relations/trade ties boost)
-Ask for military aid (China gets event “Bangladesh Requests Military Aid”)

Bangladesh Requests Military Aid
“A high-power delegation from Bangladesh recently requested an expansion of bilateral relations. In particular, they were interested in acquiring tanks. Many Bangladeshi officers, who trained when it was part of Pakistan, are familiar with our technology. This represents an effort from Bangladesh to shy away from India and allow us greater influence in the country. Bangladesh has key ports leading to the Bay of Bengal. Some senior officials do not believe Bangladesh will truly turn from India or offer much in return, they suggest we simply commit to expanding bilateral and trade ties.”
-Provide tanks (Bangladesh gets “Chinese Agree to Provide Military Aid”)
-Keep in cordial (boost in relations/trade ties)

Chinese Agree to Provide Military Aid
“The Chinese government confirmed it will begin the transfer of over two hundred tanks for the Bangladesh Army. The government welcomed the news, along with the media. The Army is elated with the new equipment, believing it provides the nation a strong deterrent to foreign aggression. Domestically, the government is being praised for its statesmanship and ability to negotiate with major powers. The Chinese are expected to expand their diplomatic presence in the country to facilitate the new agreement.”
-Excellent (250 Type 59 Tanks, Chinese influence on Bangladesh increases)

Open the Gulf
“Upon independence, Bangladesh embraced a secular ideology. Unfortunately, many Muslim states wrongly interpreted this as a suppression of Islamic identity, when this was far from the truth. Bangladesh has always remained a devout nation. President Ziaur Rahman has publicly returned Islamic greetings and invocations in public events, indicating that though the government remains secular, it will not hide the Islamic identity of the people. With our religious credentials secured, we can now approach Saudi Arabia to normalize talks and find opportunities for our people in the rich Kingdom.”
-Approach the Saudis (Saudi Arabia gets event, “Bangladesh Wishes to Hold Talks”)

Bangladesh Wishes to Hold Talks (Saudi event)
“The government of Bangladesh privately approached us, asking to hold talks. They seek to normalize ties with our people. Our close relations with Pakistan and their initial embrace of secularism at the expense of Islamic identity previously held relations back. Pakistan no longer appears too concerned over foreign relations with Bangladesh. The current government in Bangladesh has also emphasized the Islamic identity of its people. Holding talks and normalizing ties would go a long way in supporting this pro-Islam government.”
-Works for us (leads to “Bangladesh-Saudis Agree to Normalize Ties)

Bangladesh-Saudis Agree to Normalize Ties (Saudi/Bangladesh event)
“Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh signed a series of agreements, strengthening bilateral ties, expanding diplomatic missions, and agreeing to regular inter-ministerial meetings. Bangladeshis are said to be happy with the agreement, as the number of Hajj pilgrims were also raised. The recent engagement with Saudi Arabia represents a wider effort by the government to more directly engage with Muslim nations over socialist.”
-Excellent (boost in trade/bilateral relations, six months later, “Bangladesh Proposes Guest Worker Agreement”)

Bangladesh Proposes Guest Worker Agreement (Saudi event)
“Since the normalization of ties, our diplomatic staff and other visitors were struck by the large numbers of professionally trained Bangladeshis. In addition, there are millions on the street, willing to work, but unable to due to the weak economy. We had signed some contracts with Bangladeshi workers to come and work in Saudi Arabia. We offer them high wages and other benefits, as long as they do not break social customs and agree to remain guest workers, not residents or citizens. The Bangladesh government recently proposed we more formalize the guest worker program to facilitate a larger number of workers and maximize the remittance they send back. This will transform our desperate for labor economy.”
-Mutually beneficial (Saudi Arabia gets spirit “Bangladesh Guest Workers” giving boost to industrial/economic construction, Bangladesh gets event “Guest Worker Agreement with Saudis Reached”)
-No need (chain ends with nothing)

Guest Worker Agreement with Saudis Reached (Bangladesh event)
“After several discussions, the framework for a Guest Worker Agreement was laid out. Saudi Arabia will be able to recruit all the non-skilled and professional labor it wishes from our country. We have a surplus in labor and Saudi Arabia presents immense opportunities for the people. Guest worker agents, companies, and advertisement will be freely allowed. In exchange, our workers will enjoy high standards of living, compared to home, and the ability to easily remit their earnings back home to families. We expect both nations will benefit greatly in the years to come.”
-Excellent (reduces negative impacts of “Stagnant Economy”, in 5 years Bangladesh gets event “Remittance Begins Flowing”)

Remittance Begins Flowing 
“Several years after the agreement on guest workers with Saudi Arabia, the impact is already being felt. Many, previously impoverished or struggling middle class families, are now acquiring new homes, high quality education for children, and consumer goods. The influx of remittance from Saudi Arabia is leading this boom. Our normally struggling economy is well-served by the large guest worker program, as the cash being sent from Saudi Arabia is supporting all major sectors of the economy. The government is being widely praised for its initiative on this program, with these new guest worker families being dubbed the fastest growing middle class in Bangladesh.”
-Boom to economy (gets national spirit “Gulf Remittance” probably lower consumer good demand as more cash is being sent to the country, also in a year “Saudi Arabia Opens New Madrassah” for Bangladesh)

Saudi Arabia Opens New Madrassah (Bangladesh event)
“As part of the flourishing ties with Saudi Arabia, the Bangladeshi government gave it permission to fund a new madrassah in the country. The new, large school, fully funded by the Saudis, will provide Islamic education to boys across Bangladesh. The Saudi Ambassador praised the new school, calling it the first of many that will help strengthen the Islamic bonds which hold the Muslim world together. Many Bangladeshis welcome the new schools as they provide free tuition, boarding, and food. Making them ideal for the more impoverished families. The President of Bangladesh released his own statement praising the new school.”
-What can go wrong (we can add that spirit we had discussed about Saudi Madrassahs, maybe “Small Saudi Madrassah Program” or this event causes the player to activate “Sunni Missionaries”)

Expand Ties with Pakistan?
“Since the separation from Pakistan, relations have cooled. However, many in the country still feel an ideological and religious connection to Pakistan. We are the two Islamic states in the subcontinent. There are several senior advisors who believe reaching out to Pakistan can re-establish historical links and give us a potential avenue in case ties with India sour. We can ask an intermediary state to approach the Pakistanis about holding talks. There are a large number of Bangladeshis who do hold negative views of Pakistan, so the decision to engage must be carefully considered.”
-Engage with Pakistan (“Bangladesh Wishes to Hold Talks” fires for Pakistan)
-No need (chain ends)

Bangladesh Wishes to Hold Talks (Pakistan event)
“An ambassador from an intermediary state sent us a message that Bangladesh wishes to hold talks. Although the separation left bitter memories, many in Pakistan still desire our nation to enjoy brotherly ties with all Muslim states. There are still many senior Bangladeshis, especially in the military who were trained in Pakistani schools. We can offer to host talks to improve bilateral and potentially trade ties. Or we can focus on improving bilateral ties while offering military training, to re-establish the defence links between our nations. The cabinet must decide which approach it wishes to offer the Bangladeshis before the talks can take place.”
-Offer to strengthen ties (Bangladesh gets “Pakistan Wishes to Strengthen Ties”)
-Offer military training (Bangladesh gets “Pakistan offer Military Training”)

Pakistan Wishes to Strengthen Ties (Bangladesh event)
“The Pakistan government have proven receptive to our efforts at improving times. Many in Pakistan believe despite the difficult past, the Muslim states must stick together in South Asia. There are indications the Pakistanis would be willing to not only improve diplomatic contacts, but also strengthen trade ties. We can decide the extent of improving bilateral ties. Regardless of our decision, we can expect a reaction from New Delhi. The people of Bangladesh look forward to normalization with a nation so many of our people struggled to found.”
-Focus on bilateral (improves relations, Bangladesh gets “India Expresses Concern over Pakistan Ties”)
-Bilateral and trade (improve some trade and relations, Bangladesh gets “India Expresses Concern over Pakistan Ties”)

Pakistan Offers Military Training (Bangladesh event)
“The Pakistan government have proven receptive to our efforts at improving times. Many in Pakistan believe despite the difficult past, the Muslim states must stick together in South Asia. There are indications the Pakistanis would be willing to not only improve diplomatic contacts, but also provide military training. Many of our officers were trained by the Pakistan Army and maintaining such contacts could prove beneficial as we build our own military capabilities. However, we would have to keep the military links private as many Bangladeshis may not react positively to such news. We could also chose to just focus on improving bilateral ties.”
-Lets stick to bilateral relations (small boost in relations, Bangladesh gets “India Expresses Concern over Pakistan Ties”)
-Sounds great (increase relations, three year spirit “Pakistan Military Cooperation” boost to morale/organization, Bangladesh gets “India Expresses Concern over Pakistan Ties”)

India Expresses Concern over Pakistan Ties (Bangladesh event)
“The Indian ambassador delivered a message from New Delhi expressing displeasure at our recent talks with Pakistan. The Indian government is not happy at the increased bilateral ties. We informed the Indians our relationships are our own affairs. Regardless, the Indians cancelled some of our cultural exchange programs and added some restrictions to trade. This is unfortunate, but we cannot accept a situation where India dictates the foreign policy of Bangladesh. The media is reporting on this spat, but the public largely supports our stance.”
-Oh well (hurts trade/relations)

#(September 1977) Japan Airlines Flight 472, event chain fires inf Ziaur Rahman in power

Hijacked Japan Airlines Flight 472 Lands in Dacca
“The Japanese Red Army (JRA) successfully hijacked Japan Airlines Flight 472 from Bombay. Five armed hijackers took control of the airplane and directed the pilot to Dacca. The hijackers are now sitting in the plane, on the tarmac, holding the 156 passengers and crew hostage. The JRA is demanding six million dollars and the release of nine imprisoned JRA members. The Japanese government is holding an emergency meeting to discuss a response. The Bangladeshi government has surrounded the plane but will await the Japanese response. President Ziaur Rahman is holding talks with his top security officials.” 
-Government must react (leads to “Bogra Cantonment Unrest”, leads to “Government Responds to Japanese Red Army Demands” for Japan)

Bogra Cantonment Unrest (Bangladesh event)
“There are reports of unrest at the Bogra Cantonment. The recent Japanese Airline hostage crisis in Dacca has led to rumors and unrest among anti-government military personnel who believe a wider coup is occurring. Armed troops were seen taking control of local government buildings and there are reports senior officers in the cantonment are under arrest. A column of loyal troops were sent to Bogra. After a tense standoff, the rebellion was quelled. However, the quelling of Bogra has not ended the rumors and there are reports of similar revolts in other garrisons. The government must brace itself for further incidents.”
-Fools (lead to “Dacca Cantonment Revolt” in three days)

Dacca Cantonment Revolt (Bangladesh event)
“An assault on the residence of President Ziaur Rahman was thwarted. Anti-government members of the Air Force with Army sympathizers launched a revolt, believing they were supporting a national coup against the President. The rebel troops temporarily seized Dacca Radio and at the international airport, at least two dozen Air Force personnel, including officers were killed. These officers were negotiating with the Japanese Red Army terrorists currently holding a Japan Airlines flight hostage on the runway. Thankfully, local Air Force and Army sector commanders were able to put down the revolt, detaining many of the rebels. The government has directed the military to immediately detain any dissident personnel.”
-Damn (in two weeks, event “Respond to the Uprising”)

Government Responds to Japanese Red Army Demands (Japan event)
“A Japan Airlines flight from Bombay was recently hijacked by armed Japan Red Army members. The plane is currently in Dacca, the hijackers are demanding six million dollars and the release of nine of their members from prison. The public is adamant we get the 156 hostages returned safely. Our international partners are urging us to refuse the demands, saying it will set a bad precedent not just for the global community but for Japan. However, the sentiment of our people and most officials is that saving human life, no matter the cost, must be the guiding ideal. A decision must be made.”
-Give in to demands (leads to “Red Army Members Released”)
-Refuse demands (“Situation Escalates” for Bangladesh/Japan)

Red Army Members Released (Japan event)
“The government agreed to the Japan Red Army hijackers demands. A Japan Airlines flight is being chartered to Dacca with the six million dollars for the hostage takers. The plane will also bring home the 156 hostages. We also released the prisoners, as instructed. Although many internationally are condemning the decision as appeasing terrorism, the Prime Minister released a statement, noting the life of a single person outweighs the earth. This sentiment resonates with the Japanese people who welcome the news. With the situation resolved, the government also announced plans to establish a robust anti-terrorism force to handle future crisis like this.”
-Oh well (leads to “Fuel Hijacked Plane” for Bangladesh)

Situation Escalates
“The Japanese government refused the demands of the Japan Red Army hijackers currently holding a plane of 156 hostages on the tarmac in Dacca. This is a major escalation, and there are fears the hijackers may act rashly. Upon hearing the news, the hijackers demanded the Bangladesh government refuel the plane and allow it to leave. President Ziaur Rahman is faced with a difficult choice, he can acquiesce to the demand, allowing the crisis to leave Bangladesh, or send in troops to storm the jet. Storming the jet will be incredibly risky, but show terrorists that Bangladesh is not a location from which to issue demands or conduct operations.”
-Fuel the plane (“Hijackers Allowed to Leave”)
-Storm the jet (leads to “Bangladesh Ends Hostage Crisis”)

Hijackers Allowed to Leave (global)
“The Japan Airlines flight 472 hijacking continues after the Bangladesh government fueled the plane and allowed it to leave the country. The plane is headed towards the middle east, though a final destination has not been given. Five armed members of the Japan Red Army took the plane hostage from Bombay, landing it in Dacca. They demanded the release of several members in Japan along with six million dollars. The Japanese government refused the demands. To avoid a violent escalation, the Bangladeshi government complied with the terrorist demand that the plane be fueled and allowed to leave with its hostages. President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh expressed his wish that the crisis be resolved without the loss of innocent lives.”
-The crisis continues (would lead to rest of chain for this hostage)

Bangladesh Ends Hostage Crisis
“In a stunning night time assault, Bangladeshi commandos stormed Japanese Airlines flight 472. The flight was recently hijacked by armed members of the Japan Red Army after it took off from Bombay. The plane was taken to Dacca where the hijackers demanded millions of dollars and the release of its members from Japanese prisons. After the Japanese government refused its demands, the Bangladeshi government decided to act to prevent the killing of hostages. The operation to storm the plane lasted only minutes, but resulted in reports heavy gunfire exchanges and explosions. The Bangladesh Army confirmed the plane was secured, with the terrorists neutralized. When asked about the condition of the hostages, the military admitted there were a number of casualties but most were rescued safely.”
-Oh no (would need to make Japanese aftermath events)

Respond to Uprising (Bangladesh event)
“The recent Japan Airlines crisis led to rumors across Bangladesh, resulting in armed rebellions by anti-government military personnel. These men thought the government had collapsed or a wider coup was in motion, resulting in major uprisings across bases. These rebellions were quickly squashed with many of the ringleaders taken into custody. President Ziaur Rahman has received two lists, one of all the military personnel involved in the unrest. The other list includes suspected police, intelligence, and other security personnel believed to have facilitated the uprisings. He must decide whether to purge just the military, or his entire security apparatus of his enemies.”
-Purge military and increase security/military
-Purge military

#Assassination of Ziaur Rahman Chain

Major Party Conflict in Chittagong (Fires several months after Ziaur Rahman chain completed)
“President Ziaur Rahman received reports that his local party officials in Chittagong are suffering from intense political infighting. The situation is deteriorating rapidly, and his presence is requested to negotiate a compromise. Moving quickly, the President has left Dacca. He plans on staying near the Army cantonment for the next few days to resolve the matter. Maintaining party discipline and unity in Chittagong is crucial for the governing of the country. Before leaving the capital, the President assured his top officials that the matter will be resolved in a matter of days.”
-Will have to restore order (leads to “Army Officers Storm Circuit Hotel” in a couple days)

Army Officers Storm Circuit Hotel
“President Ziaur Rahman is dead. A group of commissioned officers, armed with submachine guns, rocket launchers, and grenades stormed the Circuit Hotel where the President was staying while on a visit to Chittagong. The assassins avoided dealing with a frontal assault, blowing up two holes in the rear of the Circuit Hotel. Before the main force of Presidential Guards could arrive, the assassins had managed to capture Ziaur Rahman before executing him at close range. Two of the assassins were killed as they escaped, one identified as a colonel. General Abul Manzoor, the Chittagong commander, took to the local radio, calling on the nation to unite and create a real nation. It appears a coup is afoot.”
-The President is dead! (leads to “General Ershad Orders Rebel to Surrender”)

General Ershad Orders Rebel to Surrender
“Fears of a coup in Bangladesh over the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman have dissipated. The serving Army Chief, General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, quickly took charge of the situation. He went on the radio and called on all rebel forces to surrender and the arrest of General Abul Manzoor. The response has effectively isolated Chittagong and the rebel leaders from the rest of the nation. The swift response by General Ershad has rallied all other major garrisons to pledge their loyalty to the government and Army hierarchy. There are reports of unrest among the troops in Chittagong over both the assassination and radio broadcasts.”
-Order restored (lead to “Coup Leader Killed”)

Coup Leader Killed
“General Abul Manzur, viewed as the mastermind behind the assassination of the late President Ziaur Rahman, was reported to have been killed, effectively ending his rebellion. Following demands by the Army Chief for Manzur and his forces to surrender, half the Chittagong garrison switched their loyalty back to the government. With the situation turned against him, General Manzur reportedly surrendered to loyalist troops without incident. However, within several hours, he was reported to be killed. Rumors are circulating that an angry group of loyalist soldiers surrounded and killed the rebel commander out of anger. Although many in the country feel justice was done, there are some rumors suggesting Manzur was killed to silence him from revealing the involvement of more senior military and civilian leaders to the coup attempt.”
-Justice (leads to “Funeral for President Rahman”)

Funeral for President Rahman
“A couple million Bangladeshis attended the funeral of the late President Ziaur Rahman in Dacca. The crowd was grief stricken, with many expressing great sorrow for the late leader. Despite his reputation as a strong-man, many felt President Rahman brought a firm hand the nation needed. His campaigns for promoting nationalism and economic stability will be a lasting memory. As the funeral ends, many in the country will be looking nervously to the future. Vice President Abdus Sattar was sworn in to assume the presidency. The seasoned elder statesman promised to continue the policies of Ziaur Rahman and hold fresh elections in the near future.”
-A moving event (leads to “President Abdus Sattar Wins Election” in six months)

President Abdus Sattar Wins Election
“Acting President Abdus Sattar, who took over following the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman, easily won the recent presidential election. Many Bangladeshis view the election results as confirmation the country remains committed to the legacy of Ziaur Rahman. President Sattar thanked the supporters of the BNP and called for a new era of development for the nation. He also revealed a vision for increasing the cooperation of national institutions. Despite the victory, there are concerns over the health and age of Sattar.”
-Democracy triumphs (in two months, event “General Ershad Assumes Power” in 4 months)

General Ershad Assumes Power
“General Hussain Muhammad Ershad has assumed the post of President and Chief Martial Law Administrator. Over the previous hours, the President and Vice President both resigned. General Ershad dissolved the parliament and announced hundreds of politicians will be arrested for corruption. The military claims it had to act following the inefficiencies of the current government. General Ershad insists that if he had not acted, anti-state forces would have plunged Bangladesh into chaos. Analysts are not surprised by the coup as the President and Army Chief had been engaged in political bickering over the past few months. A recent decision to remove military officers from administrative posts is seen as the last draw. Bangladeshis look towards an uncertain future.”
-A new era (Ershad Tree opens in the 80s)


FOCUS DESCS

Restore Rural Order (Description)
"The advent of independence revealed chaos in the countryside. Local administrators and police abandoned their post. The government must re-establish police stations and a sense of security to the people."
Invite Pakistan to Liquidate Assets (description)
"Pakistani nationals still possess a number of assets across Bangladesh. It is a legacy of the exploitation our people faced. Although it is well within our rights to seize these assets, to do so would risk weakening our international standing and hurt foreign investment. Instead, we will offer these Pakistanis a fair compensation, and then liquidate these assets to the people of Bangladesh."
Reduce Foreign Dependence (Description)
"Our people have long been used as a source of exploitation by foreign powers. As such, the economy is structured to facilitate this draining of national wealth abroad. The government will initiate a series of tariffs and ban certain imports to spur the emergence of a national economy." (leads to spirit "Tariffs and Protections" should give boost to infra/factory construction but also increase the costs)
Transitioning to Mixed Economy (description)
"Our five year plan has successfully put Bangladesh on the path of economic independence and equality. The exploitive elements of our economy are being removed while the foundation for a new economy of socialism and equality is laid out."

Remove AL Members From Civil Service (description)
"Die-hard Awami League members, many lacking the proper qualifications or training, were appointed to key civil service posts. In order to restore order and reduce corruption, these Awami League members must be removed."
Rehabilitate Former Bureaucrats (description)
"The previous government removed those civil servants trained in the colonial or Pakistan period. Often replacing them with political appointees who lacked proper qualifications. The government will bring these officials back to the civil service. Appointments will be based on qualification and experience, not political allegiance."
Strengthen Local Police Forces (description)
"The overly centralized style of governance by the previous regime meant local institutions were declining rapidly. This gave way to a rise in criminal activity, especially in the countryside. This heavily hindered the internal movement of goods and services. The government will initiate a new program to pump funds to local police units and re-introduce pre-independence officers who had been forced into early retirement."
Deploy Troops in the Countryside (description)
"The centralized style of rule from the previous government meant very little resources were available to the rural areas, especially the police.

Empower Local Councils (description)

The Local Councils will ensure effective governance by local people trusted in the villages."
Investigate Suspected Officers (description)
"The President understands the previous period of political instability was driven by military officers deeply engaged with politics. Chain of command was often ignored and politicians could call on specific units to protect them.

Restore Army Discipline (description)
"Military officers of various ranks have been involving themselves in politics and unsanctioned violence. In some units commanding officers are powerless in the face of politically connected subordinates. This situation is intolerable, President Ziaur has ordered a thorough crackdown on insubordination from top to bottom."
Support Bangladesh Nationalism (description)
"The Awami League and others advocated a cultural, Bengali nationalism. However, this leaves out the Biharis and other minorities in the country. Instead, the country should embrace a new nationalism based on a Bangladeshi identity, not an exclusively Bengali one."
Re-Islamisation of Bangladesh (description)
"The traditional Islamic greeting, the call to prayer, and invocation of Islam when starting official government events will become standard practice. The nation remains secular, however, the previous governments were promoting a secularism at the expense of the Islamic identity of Bangladeshis. This will no longer be tolerated."
Establish Gram Sarkar (description)
"The new self-government village system called Gram Sarkar will give local authorities a much wider breadth of government power. This will expand democracy on the grassroots level to the people. Government initiatives meant to lift rural people will also be more effectively carried out on the village level."
Establish Village Defence Party (description)
"With the success of the Gram Sarkar system, a new Village Defence Party system is being implemented.

Establish BJR Research Institute (description)

Codify Central Committees (description)
"The Central Committee finalized its rules, regulations, and powers. They have been bound and released to the public. The decision to write down and release the procedures of the Central Committee are meant to provide the public confidence in their leaders.

Formalize Rural Militias (description)
"The rural militias formed to protect the people from criminal elements and corrupt government officials are to be formalized as part of the military.

Expand Collectivization (description)

To make the land fertile and break the feudal class, the government announced a new plan to expand collectivization across the country. This will help bring the early end to the feudal landlord classes."
Confiscate Excess Wealth (description)
"The elite landlord classes along with urban capitalists have spent centuries working with enemies of the people to steal the wealth of the nation for themselves. This will no longer be the case.

With a devotion to the nation, the people will be eager to make the sacrifices for the national cause."
National Bank Reform (description)

(as noted, once this is complete, depending on player’s choice in previous tree, either constitution a or constitution b event launches)
Awami League Government (description)
"Despite calls for a unity government, the people overwhelmingly support the agenda of the Awami League. It would not be fair to deny the people their choice just to ease the ego of the opposition. The Awami League will bring socialism, secularism, and prosperity to the people."
Form the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini (description)
"Bangladesh faces unprecedented security challenges, especially in rural areas. Armed bands and corrupt officials run rampant. To solve the issue a new force called the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini has formed. It will become a paramilitary force to target violent groups and support law enforcement.

Approach Pakistan for Final Status (description)
"With the new constitution in force, elections, and a partition of responsibilities, the stage is set for a final decision on the Pakistan Federation.

Pro-federation supporters hope East Pakistan can once again go under federal rule but with a degree of autonomy."
