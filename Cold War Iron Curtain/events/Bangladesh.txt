The Economy of Bangladesh
"The people of Bangladesh deserve peace and prosperity. Our people were victims of colonial exploitation for centuries and now control their own destiny. The government recently received two proposed five-year plans. One, developed by leading political leaders and academics envisions a nation transitioning to socialism. This plan offers an ambitious effort to provide dynamic thinking for the growth of society. The other plan, developed by the traditional bureaucratic institutions, offers a more modest series of reforms, meant to transition Bangladesh into a stable, independent economy. Many in the government favor the academic plan as it offers a new approach to economic development and breaks from the traditional mechanisms. However, too rapid a change could cause problems for the fledging state."
-Academic Plan (opens that side of the tree)
- bureaucratic plan (opens that side of the tree)
-Reduces negative impact of "Rural Unrest"
Begin Nationalizing Jute Industries
"Jute remains one of the most vital industries in Bangladesh and historically a source of our exploitation. The British and then Pakistanis ran the jute mills, draining the wealth from the nation. With independence, many of these jute mills are sitting inactive. Some recommended the government auction these industries to private businesses and corporations. However, this would only encourage a new wave of exploitation. The government will begin the process of nationalizing these jute mills and bring them into operation. The workers and mills are now under the control of the Bangladesh Jute Mill."
-excellent ("Removes "Jute Industry in Turmoil" with "Nationalized Jute Industry", in a year fire this event "Nationalized Jute Mills Suffer Problems")
Nationalized Jute Mills Suffer Problems
"A recent report notes jute production in the country is far lower than during the pre-independence period. Expenses at the mill are also far higher. The unions are being accused of providing excessive difficulties to the administrators. The administration also faced stinging criticism in the report. Its members are accused of absenteeism and being unqualified. Many members of the Bangladesh Jute Board are political appointees with little to know knowledge of the industry. Despite these major setbacks, the government insists it will not privatize the mills, though it has promised reforms to curb inefficiencies. There are plans to end the Bangladesh Jute Board and place it under the Finance Ministry."
-Damn (Modifies "Nationalized Jute Industry" makes its positive impact very little, at least should increase consumer goods demand as industry drains government funds, in ten years new event "Committee Recommends Privatization of Jute Industry")
Committee Recommends Privatization o Jute Industry
"A committee of economists and senior civil service officials recently published a report after investigating the government-run Bangladesh Jute Board. They noted efforts at reforming inefficiencies have been ineffective. Unions remain difficult to manage, especially with an administration staffed by members with little experience in business or the jute industry. The recent reform of creating a separate Jute Ministry to cut costs has had little impact. The report recommends the government begins privatizing the mills which are a drain on the finances of the country. However, the years of commitment towards state control means complete privatization is not possible. The government plans on slowly privatizing some jute mills to assess the situation."
-Initiate some reforms (replaces spirit "Nationalized Jute Industry" with "Semi-Privatized Jute Industry", should have same effects, in two years "Assessment of Semi-Privatized Jute Industry"
Assessment of Semi-Privatized Jute Industry
"Following recommendations from an expert committee, the government recently privatized around a dozen jute mills. In addition, the government initiated several incentives to spur growth. However, a recent assessment concludes the private jute mills are producing at the same or only slightly higher than government run mills. This is disappointing news for the economy, though the report gives more ammunition to those advocating the government not give up its stake in the industry completely. The government said it will curtail the pace of privatization but continue to provide incentives and subsidies to the industry."
-Damn ("Assessment of Semi-Privatized Jute Industry" very little boost to economy, however, consumer good demand should be a quarter of what it was under "Nationalized Jute Industry")


Econ Branch (Bureaucratic Five Year Plan)
Codify Industrial Relations (event)
"The Finance Ministry released a series of regulations to codify industrial relations between the management and workers. These are meant to better lay out exactly what legal recourse both sides have in regards to negotiations or declaring strikes. Worker groups are criticizing the decision, noting Bangladesh still lacks vital legislation on the issue, giving factory owners an unfair advantage. The leading business association also criticized the regulations as a roadmap to allow workers to effectively carry out protests without violating the law. Despite these criticisms, the Finance Ministry insists the decision will help resolve current conflicts and spur more legislation in the future."
-It is done (3 year spirit "Industrial Labor Tensions" drop in stability, slight drop in productivity)
Incentivize Jute Development (event)
"Jute is a vital industry for Bangladesh. During colonial period, the jute produced in the land went to what is now India for processing. Despite the potential and promises, little has been done to build a processing capability in Bangladesh itself. To rectify this, new incentives and protections are being offered internationally to encourage foreign investment in the jute industry. Bangladesh has a potential for great growth but needs to do so with help from finance abroad. Diplomatic missions will soon begin publicizing the new opportunities."
-Awesome (60% chance in 6 months get "Some Support for Jute Development", 40% change in 6 months get "Huge Support for Jute Development")
Some Support for Jute Development
"Our efforts at encouraging foreign investment to expand jute processing facilities bore some fruit. We attracted funding from some development organizations and a few investment groups. However, this is less than we anticipated when launching the effort. It appears most people still view our nation as a risky investment. Despite this, we are able to expand some of our processing capabilities which will provide a boon for the economy. More importantly, it allows us to benefit more by exporting products produced from jute instead of just the raw material."
-Good effort (add one civ factory)
Huge Support for Jute Development
"Our efforts at encouraging foreign investment to expand jute processing facilities bore fruit. Diplomatic missions and the Finance Ministry were bombarded with requests from investment groups and organizations interested in the proposed program. It appears our nation is seen by many as a land of opportunity. We are able to not just greatly expand the processing of jute in the country but also have attracted enough foreign partners to maximize profit opportunities. This is a major success for the people of Bangladesh."
-Excellent (add two civ factories and finance building)
Support Foreign Investments (event)
"We are currently receiving some new interest for foreign investments in Bangladesh. The Finance Ministry believes it will be in the interest of the nation if we can focus on a specific developmental area to maximize this increase. Some experts believe we should direct this support towards building up infrastructure across the nation. Other experts see a focus on developing energy as being paramount to building a foundation for future economic growth. Some of the top political leadership insists the focus should be on new industries to provide more jobs to the people. A decision must be made soon."
-Focus on infra (add some infra)
-Focus on power (add a couple powerplants)
-Focus on factories (add two civ factories)
Sell-Off Excess Lands (event)
"The previous Pakistan regime continued to hold large tracts of land it inherited from the British regime. The military later on seized more land, ostensibly for security reasons. After an extensive survey, the government has identified large amounts of agriculturally viable land that can be returned to the peasants. It just needs to be determined how to distribute the land. One option is to redistribute the land to landless peasants. The other option calls for the public sale of these lands. Supporters of the former believe this will rectify the continued oppression of peasants in the nation. Those wanting a public sale note if someone buys the land, they will likely put in the investment necessary to make it worthwhile."
-Redistribute to the peasants (add 4 agri buildings, 3 year spirit "Land Redistribution", slight increase in civ factory demand, make agricultural output less, boost in stability)
-Public sale (3 years "Public Land Sales", reduce civ factory demand, make agricultural buildings cheaper, in six months get event "Peasant Agitation over Land Sales")
Peasant Agitation over Land Sales
"Our peasants are infuriated by the decision to publicly sell-off excess government lands. They argue this land should have been returned to the people who desperately need it. Many peasant families claim they have virtually no opportunity to gain land are increasingly being coerced to work under landlords. Certain officials are being accused of massively profiting from the sales. There are increasing incidents of peasants refusing to work or reducing the amount of work put in to protest what they see as a dire situation."
-Oh well ("Peasant Agitation", which is already a spirit, so if it is on, then I guess the only effect would be reduce stability)


FOCUS DESCS
Mixed Economy Growth (description)
"The recent economic initiatives have set Bangladesh on a path of a true mixed economy. We will gain the benefits of both a free market and socialist economy. Providing the potential of growth while also preserving the people from exploitation. Balancing our economy is the key for the stable economic growth of Bangladesh."
Seize Pakistan Assets (Description)
"A number of private Pakistani corporations and businessmen continue to hold assets. These carpetbaggers have long drained our wealth to their bank accounts in Lahore. We will seize these assets in the name of the people."
-5 year spirit "Seized Pakistan Assets" should lower consumer good demand
Expand Worker Rights (Description)
"The previous regime and the British colonial state long suppressed the rights of workers in our land. The time to rectify this is now. The government will recognize unions and legalize the right to strike."
-5 year spirit "Expanded Worker Rights" increase in stability, increase in consumer good demand
Restore Rural Order (Description)
"The advent of independence revealed chaos in the countryside. Local administrators and police abandoned their post. The government must re-establish police stations and a sense of security to the people."
Invite Pakistan to Liquidate Assets (description)
"Pakistani nationals still possess a number of assets across Bangladesh. It is a legacy of the exploitation our people faced. Although it is well within our rights to seize these assets, to do so would risk weakening our international standing and hurt foreign investment. Instead, we will offer these Pakistanis a fair compensation, and then liquidate these assets to the people of Bangladesh."
Reduce Foreign Dependence (Description)
"Our people have long been used as a source of exploitation by foreign powers. As such, the economy is structured to facilitate this draining of national wealth abroad. The government will initiate a series of tariffs and ban certain imports to spur the emergence of a national economy." (leads to spirit "Tariffs and Protections" should give boost to infra/factory construction but also increase the costs)
Transitioning to Mixed Economy (description)
"Our five year plan has successfully put Bangladesh on the path of economic independence and equality. The exploitive elements of our economy are being removed while the foundation for a new economy of socialism and equality is laid out."
Modernize Water Distribution (Description)
"The government announced a new initiative to modernize water distribution across rural areas of the country. The old infrastructure is now decades old and in need of an upgrade. The effort is being widely praised as an example of state institutions cooperating for the betterment of the people."
Remove AL Members From Civil Service (description)
"Die-hard Awami League members, many lacking the proper qualifications or training, were appointed to key civil service posts. In order to restore order and reduce corruption, these Awami League members must be removed."
Rehabilitate Former Bureaucrats (description)
"The previous government removed those civil servants trained in the colonial or Pakistan period. Often replacing them with political appointees who lacked proper qualifications. The government will bring these officials back to the civil service. Appointments will be based on qualification and experience, not political allegiance."
Strengthen Local Police Forces (description)
"The overly centralized style of governance by the previous regime meant local institutions were declining rapidly. This gave way to a rise in criminal activity, especially in the countryside. This heavily hindered the internal movement of goods and services. The government will initiate a new program to pump funds to local police units and re-introduce pre-independence officers who had been forced into early retirement."
Deploy Troops in the Countryside (description)
"The centralized style of rule from the previous government meant very little resources were available to the rural areas, especially the police. As such, smuggling, violence, and robbery are a major problem. To tackle this issue, the government will deploy Army troops from cantonments to bolster the local police and restore order."
Empower Local Councils (description)
"The government announced plans to give extensive powers to Local Councils established across rural areas of the country. Many villages complained the previous, centralized system moved too slowly, unable to react effectively to important issues. The Local Councils will ensure effective governance by local people trusted in the villages."
Investigate Suspected Officers (description)
"The President understands the previous period of political instability was driven by military officers deeply engaged with politics. Chain of command was often ignored and politicians could call on specific units to protect them. The military is launching an extensive investigation to identify, dismiss, or reform, any personnel found to be engaged in politics or anti-state ideologies. Chain of command must be restored."
Restore Army Discipline (description)
"Military officers of various ranks have been involving themselves in politics and unsanctioned violence. In some units commanding officers are powerless in the face of politically connected subordinates. This situation is intolerable, President Zia has ordered a thorough crackdown on insubordination from top to bottom."
Support Bangladesh Nationalism (description)
"The Awami League and others advocated a cultural, Bengali nationalism. However, this leaves out the Biharis and other minorities in the country. Instead, the country should embrace a new nationalism based on a Bangladeshi identity, not an exclusively Bengali one."
Re-Islamisation of Bangladesh (description)
"The traditional Islamic greeting, the call to prayer, and invocation of Islam when starting official government events will become standard practice. The nation remains secular, however, the previous governments were promoting a secularism at the expense of the Islamic identity of Bangladeshis. This will no longer be tolerated."
Establish Gram Sarkar (description)
"The new self-government village system called Gram Sarkar will give local authorities a much wider breadth of government power. This will expand democracy on the grassroots level to the people. Government initiatives meant to lift rural people will also be more effectively carried out on the village level."
Establish Village Defence Party (description)
"With the success of the Gram Sarkar system, a new Village Defence Party system is being implemented. This will allow the local councils to control, direct, and fund village police/self-defence patrols. The new reform will strengthen security in the villages and finally curb the lawlessness of rural Bangladesh."
Youth Workshops  (description)
"The Awami League and its youth wing spent years fostering ties with university and secondary school students. President Zia wishes to harness this youth power away from partisan politics. The government will organize Youth Workshops across the country for young people to learn and promote Bangladeshi nationalism."
Population Planning (description)
"The leading economists in the country note our high birthrate is the greatest threat to sustainable, economic growth. The economy will eventually be completely unable to match its growth with the increase in population. To combat this issue, a new national campaign, targeting communities with high birthrates, will educate the population on the benefits of family planning."
Establish BJR Research Institute (description)
"The President opened the Bangladesh Jute and Rice Institute. This new facility, the first of several planned, will improve agricultural research and planning for the nation. Top researchers and officials will study at the institute and be able to implement experiments to improve the agricultural sector of the economy."
New Infrastructure Program (description)
"A healthy national economy relies on the fast, efficient movement of goods across domestic markets. The government announced a new focus and funding initiative to support the construction of new infrastructure projects to better connect all the people of Bangladesh."
Reverse Collectivization (description)
"The first government sought to implement agricultural collectivization. However, the practice was alien to our peasants and saw a major drop in production. The President announced plans to end collectivization schemes across the country and return farms to the producers."
Expand Rural Electrification (description)
"The rural areas have been neglected by the state since the Mughals ruled the land. Yet these peasants make the backbone of our economy. To aid their lives and offer more opportunities, the government announced the opening of new power plants meant to provide electricity to neglected communities."
Ban All Political Parties (description)
"The JSD Central Committee confirmed a ban on all political parties in Bangladesh. It noted the state must be supreme and undivided by partisan politics. All political offices are directed to shutdown and all materials for non-JSD political parties are to be confiscated for destruction."
Complete Secularization (description)
"The government announced a ban on the use of any Islamic phrasing on government materials, media broadcasts, or by party officials addressing the population. The JSD claims it is not suppressing Islam, but simply establishing the conditions of a secular state, as envisioned by the founders of Bangladesh. Grassroot Muslim community leaders are said to be infuriated by this change of policy."
Codify Central Committees (description)
"The Central Committee finalized its rules, regulations, and powers. They have been bound and released to the public. The decision to write down and release the procedures of the Central Committee are meant to provide the public confidence in their leaders. Critics claim the JSD operates with impunity, but the written records of state organs prove those critics wrong."
Formalize Rural Militias (description)
"The rural militias formed to protect the people from criminal elements and corrupt government officials are to be formalized as part of the military. The military are to incorporate these forces when necessary and provide them with access to weapons and facilities. Some military officers are complaining the militias are not compatible, but those officers will soon be brought in to be educated on the merits of our plan."
Expand Collectivization (description)
"Agriculture remains a critical component of the economy. Our people were long victims of landlords and colonial exploitation. To make the land fertile and break the feudal class, the government announced a new plan to expand collectivization across the country. This will help bring the early end to the feudal landlord classes."
Confiscate Excess Wealth (description)
"The elite landlord classes along with urban capitalists have spent centuries working with enemies of the people to steal the wealth of the nation for themselves. This will no longer be the case. Banks are directed to confiscate funds from individuals who have wealth far beyond what is necessary. For those holding excessive properties, they will be forced to hand much of that income to the state."
Urban Infrastructure Project (description)
"The Urban Development Project Phase I is nearing completion. It will provide strong urban infrastructure improvements, to better prepare the nation for an industrial revolution. The project highlights how strong the nation is when it comes together."
Youth Programs (description)
"The government announced a series of Youth Programs across the country. These involve civil education, sports, and the arts. This will encourage unity, education, and patriotism among the people of Bangladesh."
Bengali Cultural Programs (description)
"Colonialism and the early post-colonial period saw the continued, sustained assault on the language, literature, and art of Bengalis. The government will launch an extensive program to teach the people their heritage and foster patriotism.
