Enosis Crisis Begins
-(if communist Greece exists, UK gets "Inform US of Our Opinion Regarding Cyprus Crisis")

Inform US of Our Opinion Regarding Cyprus Crisis (UK event)
THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.141.d:0 "The Enosis Crisis began following the collapse of the internationally agreed upon Cyprus constitution. The new regime has declared Enosis or unification with Greece. The Turkish military on the island has seized the northern part of the island, claiming it is protecting the Turkish Cypriotes from oppression. This puts our NATO ally Turkey, in a collision course with the Soviet ally Greece. Senior military officials believe we should tell the Americans we support Turkey and their just cause for protecting the interests of all Cypriotes. Other officials feel our own experience showed Cyprus cannot be tamed and is not worth a world war. We must decide our position on this issue and inform the United States."
-We should support Turkey (US gets "UK Backs Turkish Intervention)
-Turkey should leave it be (US gets "UK Believes Cyprus Not Worth War")

UK Backs Turkish Intervention (US)
"The British ambassador recently met with the President to discuss the Enosis Crisis in Cyprus. He noted the United Kingdom had extensive experience with the island and concluded the Turkish action, though hastily done, was justified. If the communist Greek regime was not challenged, it could encourage similar communist plots in the region and along the border of other NATO states. A failure to back Turkey could also be viewed as not only appeasement but a betrayal of an ally. The ambassador added the United Kingdom would keep its opinion private for the moment and follow our lead on the matter."

UK Believes Cyprus Not Worth War (US)
"The British ambassador recently met with the President to discuss the Enosis Crisis in Cyprus. He noted the United Kingdom had extensive experience with the island and concluded the Turkish action was reckless. The United Kingdom recommends our government push Turkey to withdraw and not let them drag NATO into a world war over Cyprus. Although many may view a failure to support Turkey as caving into communist demands, this is not the case. The ambassador added the United Kingdom would keep its opinion private for the moment and follow our lead on the matter."

Respond to Turkish Occupation in Communist Greece (US event)
"In a kneejerk reaction, Turkish forces have occupied northern Cyprus. This has caused a major international crisis as it puts Turkey, our NATO ally, in a hostile position towards Greece, a Soviet ally. Turkey feels, rightly, that the Greek machinations are behind the collapse of the Cyprus constitution. However, supporting the Turkish action could result in a conflict with the Soviet Union. Such a conflict would be disastrous for Turkey as it would find itself in a two-front war. As a result, there are some officials saying we should threaten Turkey with expulsion from NATO if they do not withdraw. Other officials believe not backing Turkey is appeasement and we should remain committed to our ally. The United Kingdom, who controlled extensive"

US Threatens NATO Expulsion over Cyprus (Turkey)
"The United States recently dispatched a high-powered delegation to Ankara for a day long discussion on Cyprus. Behind closed doors the Americans unequivocally stated they expected us to withdraw from Cyprus and de-escalate the crisis. The Americans say we unilaterally escalated the situation and now the world is at risk of a global war. They added such a conflict would put us in a two-front war, with the Soviets attacking from the east. It is clear if the situation on Cyprus escalates, the United States will expel us from NATO and leave us to face an overwhelming communist invasion. Many in the cabinet are now in favor of a withdrawal, the Americans did say they would back a future agreement regarding the protection of Turkish Cypriotes. However, some officials feel the United States is bluffing and politically it cannot allow a major communist victory. We must decide how to proceed."
-Stand down ("Turkey Withdraws from Cyprus")
-Stay the Course (US gets "Turkey Refuses to Withdraw")

Turkey Withdraws from Cyprus 
"Foreign reporters and Greek forces in Cyprus confirmed the withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Cyprus. The Turkish government has not confirmed the news. Many observers are linking the withdrawal to the recent visit to Ankara by a high-powered delegation from the United States. It appears the United States and NATO were not interested in supporting the Turkish decision to seize the northern part of the island. The Greek government released a statement promising that all citizens on Cyprus, regardless of their identity, would enjoy prosperity and protection under the revolution."
-An end to the crisis (northern Cyprus ceded to Greece, chain ends)

Turkey Refuses to Withdraw (US event)
"Following our warning to Turkey about continuing to escalate the crisis in Cyprus, its government sent a message that it would not withdraw its forces. Turkey claims if its forces withdraw, they will condemn Cypriote Turks to annihilation. It added that Turkey would not seek to capture the island or start an armed conflict but it could not withdraw. We are now left with a difficult choice, we can go through with our promise and call an emergency NATO meeting to expel Turkey. Or we can wait and see how this plays out, perhaps open a dialogue with the Soviets on de-escalating the situation. Abandoning Turkey at this stage could result in a major diplomatic setback and open the door for a communist invasion of Turkey."
-Expel them ("Turkey Expelled from NATO")
-Reach out to the Soviets (leads to "Americans Have Proposal for Cyprus")

Turkey Expelled from NATO
"In a stunning emergency meeting, NATO voted to expel Turkey from the organization. Turkey faced accusations for dangerously pushing the alliance into a global conflict to satisfy its own interests. Turkey was quick to accuse the organization of hypocrisy, noting it was being betrayed by its so-called allies. There are reports of protests in front of NATO member embassies in Ankara. The Turkish government is also said to be demanding an immediate downgrade of NATO diplomatic missions within its borders. The vote proved contentious and there are rumors some NATO members are questioning whether the decision has made the alliance impotent."
-Damn (Greece gets, "Ask Permission to Issue Ultimatum on Isolated Turkey", Turkey removed from NATO)

Americans Have Proposal for Cyprus (Soviet event)
"Through private channels, the Americans have reached out. They are growing increasingly concerned over the ongoing crisis in Cyprus. They feel, as do many of our officials, that it would be disastrous if a conflict with Greece or Turkey turns escalates into a global conflict. The Americans propose we press Greece and Turkey to accept a partition of the island, with a promise to eventually resolve the conflict through bilateral discussions. It is clear discussions in the Western media that the United States will not back Turkey in the conflict is not true. Our diplomats confirmed the Americans will remain committed to Turkey but are looking to de-escalate the crisis."

"In a surprise move, the United States and Soviet Union released a joint statement claiming the crisis in Cyprus will soon be resolved. Neither the Greek or Turkish government indicated such a plan was in the works, leading to rumors the two major powers came to an agreement without them. Some officials in both nations have privately confirmed they were only informed of the plan hours before its release and pressed into agreeing. The details of the plan call for a partition of Cyprus, with Turkey occupying the Turkish neighborhoods and Greece taking the rest of the island. Greece and Turkey have also agreed to eventually reach a bilateral resolution to permanently settle the issue."

Turkey-Greece Resolve Cyprus Crisis (greece/Turkey event)
"Following intense negotiations, brokered by the United States and Soviet Union, the Cyprus Crisis appears to have been resolved. Turkey will take control of northern Cyprus, to oversee the Turkish community on the island. The rest of the island will be controlled by Greece. Both sides agreed to resolve the issue through bilateral discussions. Nationalists in both countries are said to be infuriated, with many believing foreign pressure forced a resolution. Regardless, both nations are reducing their military alert levels. Turkish and Greek forces on the island are establishing a working boundary."

Ask Permission to Issue Ultimatum on Isolated Turkey (Greece event)
"During an emergency meeting between government and military leaders, discussions were held on whether to ask the Soviet Union permission to issue an ultimatum against Turkey. The recent decision by NATO to expel Turkey has isolated them. Many of the senior military leaders believe the current situation gives us the potential to achieve a decisive victory. The only drawback is if the Soviets refuse to back us, we will be unable to press for a military resolution in Cyprus. Ultimately the government must decide what action to take."

Greece Wants Ultimatum on Isolated Turkey (Soviet)
"The Greek government wishes our consent in allowing them to issue an ultimatum against Turkey. They want Turkey to withdraw its forces from Cyprus or be forcibly evicted. Greece pointed out that NATO recently evicted Turkey over its actions on Cyprus. They note this may be the best opportunity to take advantage. Many senior officials agree with this assessment, but there are some who feel we should deny the Greek request. Instead, they feel we could use this opportunity to persuade Turkey into close ties with us. Bringing Turkey into our sphere would completely secure our southern front. A refusal could also infuriate the Greek government. A decision must be made soon."

Soviets Refuse Permission for Ultimatum
"The Soviet government has refused our request to place an ultimatum on Turkey for their blatant interference on Cyprus. This is very disappointing news as we felt strongly the situation was heavily in our favor. Our top defense experts fear a failure to act now could give Turkey the time it needs to prepare for any action. The Soviets only stated the moment was not right for any action. Our ambassador in Moscow believes there are several factors effecting the Soviet decision. Some in their government feel a conflict with Turkey could lead to a wider war with the West. There is also a feeling that Turkey could be a potential site of revolutionary activity in the future. Regardless, we must follow their decision and trust it."

Should We Back Down? (Turkey event)
"The communist regime in Greece recently issued an ultimatum calling for us to withdraw our forces from Cyprus. This would put the local Cypriote Turkish population at risk and alienate our people. However, it is clear the Soviet Union plans on aiding Greece, especially since NATO will not back us and we are isolated internationally. There are grave concerns on how long we can hold off a major communist onslaught. Many senior officials are urging the government to withdraw from Cyprus, avoid war, and wait for a better time to support our brothers on Cyprus. The decision is up to the government on how to proceed."
-Withdraw from Cyprus (leads to "Turkey Withdraws from Cyprus")
-Stay the course (in three days "Senior Military Leaders Meet")

Turkey Withdraws from Cyprus
"The Turkish government announced it will withdraw its soldiers from Cyprus. It claimed the decision is not due to the Greek ultimatum but because the Turkish government wishes to exhaust all peaceful options first. It appears the likely intervention of the Soviet Union in the event of a conflict pushed the Turkish government to stand down and avoid conflict. Many prominent Cypriote Turks are said to be leaving with the Turkish force, as they fear persecution or detention by the Greek government. Somber rallies were held in solidarity with the Cypriote Turks across the country."

Senior Military Leaders Meet
"At the behest of senior military commanders, the Prime Minister held a closed-door meeting. Afterwards, aids reported the Prime Minister seemed shaken afterwards. The next morning, he called a cabinet meeting and informed the government Turkey would withdraw its forces from Cyprus effective immediately. This is a complete turnaround in policy and will effectively end the Cyprus Crisis in favor of Greece. Rumors are circulating that the generals, fearful of the existential threat posed by the likely Soviet intervention on the side of Greece, threatened to take power from the government unless they reversed course. If the rumors are true, this is truly a dark day for the Cypriote Turks and democracy in Turkey."

The Soviet Union issued a statement saying its forces would intervene for the sake of international peace. The United States declared it would bring its full support to protect the people of Turkey from the threat of international communism.

"Our forces and brave allies achieved an overwhelming victory over NATO in Turkey. The enemies of the proletariat were justly overwhelmed. Once again, we demonstrated that imperialist pawns cannot halt the will of the people. The Greek government wishes to seize large swaths of Turkey, to restore the historical territory of Greece. Our own officials believe we should take eastern Turkey, including Kars to ensure our southern flank is secure. However, there are those who feel such territorial demands may only cause long-term problems and opportunities for our enemies to exploit in the future. They instead propose more modest territorial claims to permanently weaken Turkey and avoid future problems. We must decide what approach to take."

"The Soviet Union and its allies revealed they wish to make extensive territorial claims on Turkey. The Soviets and Greeks are seeking to implement the territorial claims Greece made on Turkey after World War I. In addition, the Soviets want to take Kars and surrounding territory to act as a buffer. Considering the present military situation, there is little we can do to stop this loss of territory. The biggest concern is how Turkey will react. This setback may cause them to re-evaluate their relationship with NATO, unless we can offer support. Major newspapers are heaping criticism on our effort in the recent conflict."

Communists Control Edirne, Istanbul and Kars (US event)
"The Soviet Union and its allies revealed they wish to make extensive territorial claims on Turkey. It appears the Soviets and Greece are seeking to limit their territorial claims to Edrine, Istanbul, and Kars. The loss of such territory will weaken Turkey and provide the Soviets a buffer. The biggest concern is how Turkey will react. This setback may cause them to re-evaluate their relationship with NATO, unless we can offer support.

Offer Neutrality, Cyprus, and Kars (Turkish event)
"Our nation suffered a massive defeat in the recent conflict with the Warsaw Pact. Our NATO alliance did not offer the protection and support we expected. Many in the country are bitterly disappointed and fear the territorial demands will cripple our nation and divide the Turkish people. There are some officials who believe we should approach the Soviets ourselves. We can offer some territorial concessions, such as giving up Cyprus and cede Kars to the Soviets to satisfy their security concerns. More importantly, we will also pledge to withdraw from NATO and maintain neutrality. This will assuage Soviet concerns and greatly weaken NATO. However, there are officials who feel this proposal, though saving territory, would leave us exposed for future aggression."

-We cannot risk being alone (no action, leads to either "Communists Confirm Territorial Gains" or "Communist Confirm Control of Edirne, Istanbul, and Kars")

Turkey Offers Neutrality, Cyprus, and Kars (Soviet event)
"The Turkish government recently sent a private peace proposal for us. They are no doubt fearful of the lands they will lose in any peace proposal due to their foolish association with NATO. The Turkish proposal offers eastern territory to us and permanently cedes Cyprus to Greece. More intriguingly, Turkey promises to withdraw from NATO and maintain strict neutrality. Many of our officials feel this proposal could remove NATO as a threat from the Eastern Mediterranean and strike a major blow to the United States. However, there are others in the government who feel we achieved such a major victory that we should not miss this opportunity to spread our influence."

-Not worth it (continues chain as before)

Soviets and Turkey Reach Agreement (global)
"In a shocking development, the Soviet Union announced it had reached an agreement with Turkey to end the NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict over Cyprus. Turkey agreed to completely give up any territory or claims to Cyprus. It also will allow a Soviet occupation of Kars and its surrounding areas to ensure peace. More significantly, Turkey will withdraw from NATO, cancel any agreements with the alliance, and maintain strict neutrality. The United States expressed its disappointment with the news while the Turkish government is being praised by many Turks for saving millions of its citizens from falling under foreign occupation. However, many observers note Turkey may have only delayed future aggression."

Communists Confirm Territorial Gains (global)
"Athens and Moscow confirmed the Warsaw Pact will take over extensive Turkish territories. The Greek government noted it has restored the historical lands of Greece, including Constantinople. The Soviets are said to be establishing a garrison in Kars, where its forces are establishing a buffer zone in eastern Turkey. Considering the extent of the Turkish and NATO defeat during the conflict, its diplomats have only issued protests against the communist expansion. The Turkish government has so far refused to comment on the situation, though sources in Ankara indicate there is a genuine feeling of despair among political and military leaders. Despite the territorial gains, some analysts warn both Greece and the Soviet Union must find a way to administer a significant Turkish population resistant to their rule."

"The Soviet Union, speaking for its Warsaw Pact allies, announced its ally Greece will take over all European lands held by Turkey, including Constantinople. It also confirmed its forces would occupy a buffer zone in eastern Turkey, centered around Kars. The loss of Istanbul and Kars will leave Turkey economically, culturally, and geographically weakened but the lost territory is not as significant as some thought. Experts suggests the Soviets do not believe Greece can absorb all the territories it had demanded. The Greek government announced a national holiday to celebrate the victory of its revolution over imperialists. The Turkish government in Ankara is said to be preparing for the influx of refugees."

Time to Rebuild (Turkish event)
"The recent conflict with Greece and its communist allies ended up being a disaster. Our NATO allies failed to adequately support us in the field, resulting in the military defeat. Now millions of Turks are under communist rule and our nation stands at its most vulnerable place. At the Grand National Assembly, a growing faction of political leaders are clamoring for us to withdraw from NATO. They feel the alliance failed and a new round of fighting could result in the end of the republic. Perhaps they are right, and we should leave the alliance and forge a new path. Many senior security officials oppose this, noting without NATO protection, the communists may just finish the job. Instead, they say we must reach out to the United States first and ask for support. If the Americans refuse to help us rebuild, then there will be no choice but to leave NATO."
-Reach out to the Americans (US gets "Turkey Asks for Support")

Turkey Withdraws from NATO
"Turkey officially withdrew from the NATO alliance. Its leaders cited the need for Turkey to rebuild itself and its inability to meet economic or military obligations for the alliance. Within Turkey the news is being met with widespread support as many Turks blame the alliance for betraying Turkey and not providing enough support during its recent conflict with communist Greece and its allies. NATO released its own statement expressing disappointment at the decision. In a terse follow up statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced its expectation that all NATO personnel should withdraw from the nation immediately and that it will review the level of NATO diplomatic missions in the country."
-Realignment (Turkey leaves NATO)

Turkey Asks for Support (US event)
"We received word from our embassy in Ankara that the Turkish government seeks a major aid package from us. Turkey suffered heavily in the recent NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict and many in Turkey blame the United States for not preventing their defeat. The embassy officials believe Turkey is not publicly asking for this aid, as this would enflame anti-US sentiment. Instead they feel an American offer would calm tensions and restore faith in NATO. A refusal to offer major support likely will lead to Turkey leaving NATO. There are a lot of advisors who support offering an aid package, however, there are some who believe the present situation of Turkey makes it a liability, and letting it leave NATO may be in our interest."
-Provide military and economic support (leads to "US Offers Massive Aid Package to Turkey")
-Not worth it (leads to "Turkey Withdraws from NATO")

US Offers Massive Aid Package to Turkey
"The United States announced it will offer a massive aid package to help rebuild the Turkish military and economy. The American government said its support is meant to provide a helping hand to a valuable friend of the United States. The announcement was welcomed by Turkey. The recent anti-NATO campaign within the Turkish parliament has largely lost momentum following news of the aid package. A more defiant Turkish government released another statement claiming it will never forget its people now behind the iron curtain. The Soviet Union criticized the United States for trying to militarize the region further."

#If Neither Side Achieves a Complete Victory
NATO-Warsaw Pact War Ends Inconclusively 
"NATO and Warsaw Pact forces halted fighting over the Greco-Turkish Crisis over Cyprus. Neither side was able to decisively defeat the other, although some territory was exchanged. From Geneva, representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union announced an agreement to withdraw forces to pre-war boundaries. Both sides will be disappointed at the result. The Soviet government released a statement claiming the fighting was a success as imperialist efforts to dismantle the revolution utterly failed. The United States noted NATO stood firmly behind its ally and prevented a communist push to forcibly destroy democracy in Turkey."

#If Turkey controls all its Victory areas
Determining Negotiating Position (US event)
"With the help of our NATO allies we not only stopped the communist aggression against Turkey but also captured huge swaths of Greek territory. The Turkish government is quite adamant they want to control northern Greece and its islands to firmly cut off Greece from its communist allies. Our experts worry that Turkey may have a hard time controlling that much territory, which could interfere with its NATO obligations. Instead, there is an alternative proposal to have Turkey occupy Rhodes, Kavala, including its surrounding areas, and Cyprus. These are more manageable and would greatly weaken the strategic position of Greece in a future conflict. A proposal to turn northern Greece into an anti-communist Greek regime is currently not seen as viable to the Turkish authorities."
-Press for Turkish claims (leads to Soviet event "NATO Make Large Territorial Demands")
-Settle for Rhodes, Kavala and Cyprus (leads to US event "NATO Control Rhodes, Kavala and Cyprus")

NATO Make Large Territorial Demands (Sov event)
"The imperialists did not surprise anyone by unveiling their nefarious plot to dismantle our revolutionary ally Greece. NATO announced it planned on occupying northern Greece and other strategic lands to ‘ensure peace in the region’. In reality, they are cutting Greece off from us and strengthening their strategic position in the region. The people of Greece and the whole world will be distraught by the news, however, we are unfortunately incapable of changing the situation due to the military situation on the ground. Despite this setback, we will not forget this humiliation."

NATO Control Rhodes, Kavala and Cyprus (Sov event)
"The imperialists did not surprise anyone by unveiling their nefarious plot to neuter our revolutionary ally Greece. NATO will hand Cyprus, Rhodes, and Kavala to Turkish military occupation. They claim this is to ensure continued peace in the region, but it is clearly a move meant to weaken the strategic position of Greece and enable a future invasion. The international community will no doubt see the true nature behind this decision. Due to the military situation, our options are limited to just declaring our opposition to the proposal."

NATO Confirm Territorial Gains (global)
"News from an emergency NATO meeting in Ankara confirmed that Turkey will be the occupying authority in the islands and northern provinces of Greece captured during the war. NATO insists the occupation is not territorial expansion, but simply a way to ensure there are no further conflicts in the region. The Soviet Union and Greek government quickly condemned the decision as punitive and designed to inflict the maximum punishment on the people of Greece. Analysts note holding this much territory may be a challenge for Turkey, but it does essentially cut Greece off from the Balkans and the Soviet Union."

NATO Confirm Control of Rhodes, Kavala and Cyprus (global)
"News from an emergency NATO meeting in Ankara confirmed that Turkey will be the occupying authority for Rhodes, Cyprus, and Kavala. The alliance claims it is only occupying those strategic locations to prevent further communist aggression from Greece and defend its interests. The decision brings an end to the recent NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict over Cyprus, which ended in a major victory for Turkey and its NATO allies. Greece and the Soviet Union condemned the occupation as a preamble for renewed conflict in the future."
-A new era (Turkey/US gain territories in Greece, Greece gets "Need to Rebuild")

Need to Rebuild (Greece event)
"The recent conflict with NATO ended in a disaster. We now find Greek workers under foreign occupation and our economy in turmoil. The military also needs to rebuild its capabilities as we would be foolish to assume the capitalists will not strike again. There is an increasing anti-Soviet sentiment, even within the party, but we are doing our best to suppress them. Considering our situation, we will dispatch a high-level delegation to ask our Soviet comrades for help in this most difficult time."
-Reach out to the Soviets (Soviets gets "Greece Asks for Support")

Greece Asks for Support (Soviet event)
"A high-level delegation arrived in Moscow to ask our help in providing them economic and military aid. The Greeks warn us a failure to back the regime may empower counterrevolutionaries and open a space for them. This is a compelling case, and our own analysts confirm these fears are well-founded. There are even reports of capitalist agents fanning the flames of discontent. As such, there is strong support to offer Greece aid. However, another faction in the government notes we also suffered heavily in the recent conflict. Perhaps we should explain to Greece that a strong Soviet Union is for the ultimate benefit of all socialist states."
-Provide military and economic support (leads to "Soviets Offer Massive Aid Package to Greece")
-We have our own problems (drop in Greece relations)

Soviets Offer Massive Aid Package to Greece (Greece event)
"Our delegation in Moscow signed a comprehensive military and economic aid package. This will greatly boost our capabilities and rebuilding efforts. It will also restore morale among the people and in the party. Unlike the past, when we allied with the capitalists, our socialist friends will not abandon the Greek people. Turkey and the United States condemned the agreement as an unnecessary military buildup. However, they must realize that regardless of the situation, the party and state will never abandon its duty to liberate all Greeks from oppression."

#ISRAEL INTERVENTION
#If UAR Invades Turkey

Respond to UAR Intervention? (Israel event)
"The United Arab Republic (UAR) has launched an invasion of Turkey, hoping to seize the Arab populated Turkish province of Hatay. They are claiming to be fighting to liberate the land and support Greece, which shares its non-aligned view, but this is utter nonsense. It is an act of aggression and a dress rehearsal to their plans for invading Israel. A successful UAR invasion could significantly strengthen this hositle regime. This is unacceptable, we must do something to weaken the UAR war effort. One option is to order a mobilization and deployment of military personnel on the UAR border. The UAR will no doubt be forced to keep troops on our border, weakening their ability to deploy reserves against Turkey. The other option is to commence the mobilization and then launch our own attack in a week. We should target Syria and its coastline to cutoff UAR forces invading Turkey."

Israeli Forces Launch Combat Operations (Israel/global event)
"The ongoing Greco-Turkish War has escalated again as Israeli forces are said to be launching operations against the United Arab Republic (UAR). The UAR recently declared war on Turkey, citing its support of Greece and in capturing the Turkish province of Hatay. The Israeli government claimed it had to act to save its nation from an increasingly aggressive, anti-Israeli regime in Cairo. Analysts believe the Israelis will likely target the Syrian territories of the UAR to isolate and cutoff the flow of supplies to the UAR forces engaged against Turkey."

#If Israel keeps its territory and Aleppo/Damascus are under enemy occupation

Israel and Turkey Dismantle UAR Regime in Syria
"The invasion of Hatay by the United Arab Republic saw a major escalation in the Greco-Turkish War over Cyprus. Within days, Israel joined the conflict on the side of Turkey, trying to stop what it saw was UAR aggression. This conflict ended in a major defeat for the UAR as its forces were defeated in Syria. Following high level talks between Israeli and Turkish officials in Damascus, Israel agreed to withdraw its forces, while Turkey oversaw the transition of power to a new Syrian government. Both sides agreed on the need to remove the UAR regime in Syria. The Turkish government praised the decision, stating Turks will be proud their people helped liberate Syria from the boot of Cairo. The UAR strongly condemned the decision, but are in no position to prevent it."
-The UAR is crippled (Syria released)

#If Fighting is Inconclusive (i.e. neither side has achieved victory)

Israel and UAR Halt Fighting
"With the Greco-Turkish War wrapping up, the fighting in the middle east has similarly come to an end. Neither the United Arab Republic or Israel managed to achieve a victory. The fighting proved inconclusive and both sides agreed to a return of pre-war borders. Both sides are claiming victory. Israel notes its forces succeeded in tying up large numbers of UAR forces from its conflict with Turkey. The UAR claims its forces repelled all Israeli attacks and destroyed huge amounts of their equipment. Despite the large boasts, neither side will gain any new territory."

#If UAR takes Haifa

"Following a ceasefire between the United Arab Republic (UAR) and Israel, the UAR confirmed it is in control of Haifa and its surrounding areas. The Israeli government has condemned the UAR for its naked aggression. The fighting had started when Israel attacked the UAR for its invasion of Turkey. In the ensuing conflict, the UAR forces managed to push Israeli forces back. There is expected to be a great deal of backlash among Israelis as many citizens are now under the occupation of an Arab state."
-Israeli Intervention Backfires (UAR takes Haifa/northern Israel, leads to "Population Infuriated by Failed Intervention")

Population Infuriated by Failed Intervention (Israeli event)
"There are massive protests being held across Israel by enraged citizens who feel Haifa and its people were abandoned to the United Arab Republic (UAR). Many Israelis believe the civil and military leadership failed the people and soldiers with their poor decision making. The government is also being accused of rushing into a conflict without preparations or a clear objective. One bitter protester asked if Haifa was worth helping the Turks. The Israeli government and military already announced a full inquiry and investigation will be conducted to understand what occurred and how to prevent it in the future."

Now the decision must be made on what to do next. The UAR is for all Arabs, so naturally many believe these lands should be integrated with the state. However, such a move could provoke unnecessary criticism by other Arab states who will argue we are annexing land. Another solution is to establish a Palestinian administration, that eventually can join the UAR once firmly in place."
-integrate lands to UAR (drop in relations with all Arab states)
-establish Palestine (leads to Palestine puppet state)

Jubilation over Liberation (event for arab states)
"Arabs across the world are cheering the United Arab Republic for their victory over the Zionists. Despite being the victim of an unprovoked attack, the valiant Arab armies proved victorious. The Egyptians are currently in control of northern Palestine and their are calls for Arabs expelled to return home. Many were moved to tears when the UAR released images of its soldiers rebuilding a village where its Arab residents were expelled during the Nakba. Despite the victory, the future status of these lands is of great interest across many Arab capitals."
-excellent (3 year spirit for all Arab countries "Arab Pride", boost stability, support for Arab nationalist party if possible)

PRC Offers Aid to Greece
"The Chinese government pledged to immediately dispatch vital aid to support the just struggle of Greece against Turkey. The announcement caught many by surprise, and there is little news on what such support would look like on the ground. Analysts believe the support may largely be in the form of economic or military equipment but cannot rule out a role for Chinese volunteers. The Turkish government condemned the Chinese announcement. The Greek government welcomed the decision, claiming it shows there are no boundaries between friends. The United States issued a warning that it would be monitoring the situation and level of Chinese support."
