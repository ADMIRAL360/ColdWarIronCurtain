THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.154.d:0 "The communist regime in Greece recently issued an ultimatum calling for us to withdraw our forces from Cyprus. This would put the local Cypriote Turkish population at risk and alienate our people.

There are grave concerns on how long we can hold off a major communist onslaught. Many senior officials are urging the government to withdraw from Cyprus, avoid war, and wait for a better time to support our brothers on Cyprus.

The Soviet Union and Greek government quickly condemned the decision as punitive and designed to inflict the maximum punishment on the people of Greece. Analysts note holding this much territory may be a challenge for Turkey, but it does essentially cut Greece off from the Balkans and the Soviet Union."

PRC Offers Aid to Greece
"The Chinese government pledged to immediately dispatch vital aid to support the just struggle of Greece against Turkey. The announcement caught many by surprise, and there is little news on what such support would look like on the ground. Analysts believe the support may largely be in the form of economic or military equipment but cannot rule out a role for Chinese volunteers. The Turkish government condemned the Chinese announcement. The Greek government welcomed the decision, claiming it shows there are no boundaries between friends. The United States issued a warning that it would be monitoring the situation and level of Chinese support."
