Should We Expand the Conflict? (India event)
-Full-on war! (war turns into a general war "UN Ceasefire Comes into Effect" in 30 days)
-No need (war remains border war)

UN Ceasefire Comes into Effect (event fires 30 days if the war becomes a general war)
-How long will this one last?

Pakistani Forces Victorious! (if at the end of general war Pakistan controls either Srinagar and/or Jammu and retain control of Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore)
-Implement UN Resolutions (launches the UN resolution chain from the 60s events)
-Hold on to our gains (Pakistan keeps hold of its territorial gains in Kashmir, leads to pakistan event "Pakistan Celebrates Kashmir Success", India gets event "Disaster in Kashmir")

Pakistan Celebrates Kashmir Success (Pakistan event)
-Pakistan Zindabad!

Disaster in Kashmir (India event)
-Damn 

India Defeats Invaders! (If in the general war Indian player, captures Azad Kashmir capital and takes one of the major cities Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, while retaining control of its major cities (Amristar, Delhi, Ahmadabad, probably missing one)
-Push Pakistan back (India takes control of Siachen area and takes Azad Kashmir, leads to Pakistan event "Disastrous Kashmir Operation", India gets event "Decisive Victory in Kashmir")
-Restore pre-war borders (leads to Pakistan event "Failed Kashmir Operation")

Indo-Pakistan Conflict Inconclusive (if neither side achieves the victory conditions)
-Pre-war borders restored (Pakistan gets event, "Failed Kashmir Operation")

Failed Kashmir Operation (Pakistan event)
-Damn

Decisive Victory in Kashmir (India event)
-Excellent

Pakistan Kashmir Operations Yield Success (if Pakistan wins border war)
-Press India to implement resolutions on Kashmir (India gets event, "Pakistan Presses for UN Resolutions")
-Hold on to our gains (Pakistan gains some strategic territory along its border in Kashmir, India gets event "Forces in Kashmir Pushed Back")

Forces in Kashmir Pushed Back (India event)
-Unfortunate

Pakistan Presses for UN Resolutions (Indian event)
-Implement UN Resolutions (starts the UN resolution chain of events from 60s events)
-We will not be bullied (ends chain, Pakistan gains some strategic territory along its border in Kashmir)

Pakistan Kashmir Operations Thwarted (if India wins border war)
-Restore pre-war boundaries (no territorial changes, India gains event "Victory in Kashmir", Pakistan gets event "Kashmir Fighting Inconclusive...")
-Hold on to our gains (India gains some strategic territory along its border in Kashmir, India gets event "Victory and Gains in Kashmir")

Victory in Kashmir (India event)
-Hopefully this will calm tensions

Victory and Gains in Kashmir (India event)
-A major victory

Kashmir Fighting Inconclusive... (Pakistan event)
-Well at least we tried...

Kashmiris Abroad For Nationalist Party (India event, from PAK_Sponsor_Kashmiri_Groups)
-Damn (India gains spirit "International Kashmiri Nationalists" should hurt India diplomatically among other effects)

Pakistan Calls for the Implementation of UN Resolutions (India event from PAK_Call_For_Implementation_Of_UN_Resolutions)
-Agree (starts the UN resolutions chain from 60s)
-No way (ends chain, spirit "Resistant to Peace" for 5 years, hurts trade relations with key states)

Call for United Nations Involvement Fails 
-Damn
