#Decision Stuff
NATO Member Decision Descriptions

Covertly Aid Greece
"Although NATO agreed to remain neutral in the conflict, we know a Greek victory would work in our national interests. We have strong intelligence links and it would not be difficult to transfer arms to aid their effort."

Covertly Aid Turkey

NATO States get decision: Covertly Aid Turkey"
Covertly Aid Turkey (decision)
"Turkey is an important NATO ally. Although its conflict with Greece is largely a bilateral dispute, we enjoy strong diplomatic and military links. Many in the government feel it is our duty to provide military equipment to aid Turkey during this difficult time. However, since many in our nation feel Turkey is culpable for starting the conflict, such support will have to be covert."

PRC get decision: Aid Greece

Aid Greece (decision)
"Greece is an important ideological partner internationally. Despite the differences, our peoples have found an ideological harmony. The people of Greece are currently engaged in a war against Turkey, a decadent, western puppet state. Our government has the ability to provide support for the people of Greece as they stand against western arrogance."
-leads to global event "PRC Offers Aid to Greece"

PRC Offers Aid to Greece
"The Chinese government pledged to immediately dispatch vital aid to support the just struggle of Greece against Turkey. The announcement caught many by surprise, and there is little news on what such support would look like on the ground. Analysts believe the support may largely be in the form of economic or military equipment but cannot rule out a role for Chinese volunteers. The Turkish government condemned the Chinese announcement. The Greek government welcomed the decision, claiming it shows there are no boundaries between friends. The United States issued a warning that it would be monitoring the situation and level of Chinese support."
