PPP Splits from Awami League (right before election campaign begins for 75 election)
“Zulfikar Ali Bhutto announced the Pakistan Peoples Party had left its coalition with the Awami League. He cited an increasing divergence in ideological goals and concern over Bengali domination of the coalition. Bhutto stated the PPP planned to lead a coalition of left and center-left parties to provide Pakistanis true Islamic socialism. An Awami League spokesman confirmed the split, blaming Bhutto for unreasonable demands on the coalition. Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman did not comment, but has been rumored to be increasingly annoyed with the ambitious PPP leader.”
-The left is divided (three coalitions running in 75 election)

1975 General Elections
“Following an especially bitter election campaign, Pakistani voters are going to the polls. The three choices are coalitions led by Mujibur Rahman, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi. The young, charismatic Bhutto leads a powerful center-left coalition. Taking some of the more moderate elements of the left from political stalwart Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Finally, Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi, a respected industrialist, commands a coalition of conservative parties focused on reducing socialism in the country and champion the Islamic principles Pakistan was founded on. The people must now decide.”
-Mujibur Rahman and the left win!
-Bhutto and the center-left win!
-Elahi and the religious right win!

Hostile Reception in Dacca (from PAK_Hold_Talks_With_Awami_League)
“The Awami League, which dominates the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly recently passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Bengal nation. This radical resolution has caused an uproar in West Pakistan and the National Assembly. The President also reacted strongly and has flown to Dacca for talks with the Awami League. As the talks began, it became clear to the President by the reception he received from the people and the Awami League that there is little faith in united Pakistan. Many in the province feel the country is drifting away from them and that the last election showed a bias is growing that prevents the growth of Bengali national leaders. The President must decide if he will seek a compromise on East Pakistan independence, or take a hardline and insist on a United Pakistan. Considering how closely integrated the two wings are militarily, there appears little chance of the situation escalating into an armed conflict as that would be catastrophic for both sides.”
-Seek a compromise (leads to event “Preparations for Bangladesh”)
-United Pakistan (leads to event “Dacca Riots”

Dacca Riots
“News of the Pakistani refusal to compromise has sparked massive riots in the federal areas of Dacca. Government buildings and courts were torched by angry protestors, in many instances the police simply stood by and did not intervene to halt the violence. This show of popular outrage has brought many advisors to suggest the President change course and accept Bangladesh, however, there are some who continue to urge him to pursue a United Pakistan. The situation is very tense.”
-Give in to Bangladesh (spirit “Bengal Agitation” leads to “Preparations for Bangladesh”)
-Pakistan must stay united

Bangladesh Day
“With talks stalling and tensions mounting both in West and East Pakistan, the Awami League called for Bangladesh Day across the province. In homes across East Pakistan, Bengalis placed homemade flags for Bangladesh to indicate their support for the Awami League efforts. This action has shaken even West Pakistanis. Many are now of the opinion if the Bengalis wish to leave so badly, the government should just let them go. The President has concurred and will inform the Awami League representatives the next time they meet.”
-We have no choice…(leads to event “Preparations for Bangladesh”

Preparations for Bangladesh
“President of Pakistan and Awami League leadership signed a public document calling for the independence of Bangladesh. The people of Dacca went into full celebration mode following the signing with music and celebration throughout the night. Over the next three months, West Pakistanis will be repatriated back to Pakistan as power is handed over. As part of the agreement, Pakistan will not be obligated to “pay” Bangladesh back for any development funds used from its revenue since independence. People in West Pakistan are taking the news in stride, many hoping this will finally end the never-ending tensions between the two wings of the country.”
-Begin the transition (ends spirit “weak coalition”, ends spirit “Bengal Agitation”)

Bangladesh Gains Independence
“Bangladesh officially joined the community of nations as the Pakistan government officially granted sovereignty to the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly. Although the Pakistani government has claimed to be comfortable with the change, many Bangladeshis noted the haste in which they evacuated their personnel and supplies from the province. More significantly, the Pakistan state sent only its foreign minister for the flag raising ceremony. Regardless, the Awami League praised the peaceful transition and hoped for continued good relations between the two brotherly nations.”
-A peaceful transition (Bangladesh gains independence)

Positive Reception in Dacca 
“The Awami League, which controls the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly recently passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Bengal nation. This radical resolution has caused an uproar in West Pakistan and the National Assembly. The President also reacted strongly and has flown to Dacca for talks with the Awami League. Upon his arrival, many residents filled the streets, cheering the presidential motorcade. The recent electoral success of the President in East Pakistan and the public support shows many in East Pakistan remain firmly committed to the state.”
-The talks begin (three days later “Awami League Stands Down”)

Awami League Stands Down
“After several days of talks, the Awami League agreed to withdraw its resolution calling for a Bengali nation. The Awami League quickly found its position of strength eroded as supporters of the government soon dominated the streets of Dacca, rallying to the President. To save face, the Pakistan government promised to support more local cultural initiatives and consider reforming how many seats East Pakistan is entitled to at the National Assembly. However, many analysts believe this last point will not result in any change. Across Pakistan, the President is enjoying widespread support, as newspaper editorials claim the recent”

Pakistan Wishes to Re-Engage (India event)
“President Mujibur Rahman of Pakistan recently sent a message calling for Foreign Minister level talks in Karachi. The Pakistanis wish to build trust with us and increase trade relations. Our senior advisors do not believe the Pakistanis wish a total engagement with us, however, even an incremental improvement in ties could lead to eventual normalization. There are some officials who believe we should reject this initiative, they think a hardline should be maintained until Pakistan fully commits to establishing neighborly relations. A decision must be made.”
-Reject the Pakistan initiative (hurts relations/trade ties)
-Accept the Pakistan initiative (leads to “Pakistan and India Hold Talks” (Pakistan/India event)

Pakistan and India Hold Talks (Pakistan/India event)
“The Foreign Ministers of Pakistan and India met in Karachi for talks. The meeting took place following a Pakistani invitation to India. The two sides signed an agreement promoting trade and increasing the number of diplomats in both states. Both governments released statements praising the agreement as a positive step in the right direction. Despite the agreement, both sides acknowledged there remained many outstanding issues that will need to be addressed in the future. Internationally, the talks are being praised. Upon reaching the Provincial Assembly building, the President addressed the media. He stated his understanding that some East Pakistanis feel disenchanted with the current electoral system and he looks forward to the upcoming talks.”
-A good start (India/Pakistan ties/trade relations boost

Awami League Stands Down
“After several days of talks, the Awami League agreed to withdraw its resolution calling for a Bengali nation. The Awami League quickly found its position of strength eroded as supporters of the government soon dominated the streets of Dacca, rallying to the President. To save face, the Pakistan government promised to support more local cultural initiatives and consider reforming how many seats East Pakistan is entitled to at the National Assembly. However, many analysts believe this last point will not result in any change. Across Pakistan, the President is enjoying widespread support, as newspaper editorials claim the recent events prove the constitution is now the supreme law for all Pakistanis. The Awami League released its own statement, claiming it had achieved great results for securing the rights of East Pakistanis. Provincialism appears to be on a path of steady decline.”
-Excellent (removes spirit “East Pakistan Agitation”)

Pakistan Requests Saudi Cooperation (Saudi event from focus PAK_Reach_Out_To_Saudi_Arabia)
“The Pakistani Ambassador delivered a message from President Elahi. He requests the Kingdom meet with him and his senior defense officers to hold talks on cementing a strategic relationship between our nations. The Pakistani President noted the historical bond linking us and the devotion our peoples feel for one another. In the past the Pakistanis have provided us with experts and military training. Many in our government are open to meeting with this high-level delegation to determine what sort of agreement could be reached. A few officials however, suggest we deny the request and not entangle ourselves with any state, no matter the relationship.”
-Accept high-level Pakistani meeting (two weeks later event, “Pakistani-Saudi Strategic Talks”)
-Rebuff the effort (end chain, Saudi tries hurt)

Pakistani-Saudi Strategic Talks (Saudi event)
“The Pakistani President and his top military and economic advisors held talks with the Saudi King and his senior ministers. During the talks, the Pakistanis proposed a comprehensive agreement. In exchange for military experts and a permanent military presence to protect the Kingdom, we would offer Pakistan economic subsidies. This is a major agreement, our advisors believe if we are not comfortable with the agreement, we could politely call for further consultations and end the meeting as a warming of ties between our nations.”
-Sign agreement (Pakistan gets “Saudi Agreement Reached”, Saudi gets “Pakistani Partnership Cemented”
-Just confirm ties are warm (ends chain, only increases relations with both)

Saudi Agreement Reached (Pakistan event)
“The Saudi government accepted our proposal and we signed the Strategic Agreement in Riyadh. The news is being very well-received among the Pakistani people. The religious parties in our coalition are especially thrilled with the agreement. The Pakistan military is already dispatching advisors and developing plans with their Saudi counterparts on potential troop deployments if needed. The Saudis have expressed an immense satisfaction to the agreement and the continued deepening of our relationship. A new era for Pakistan-Saudi relations has begun.”
-Excellent! (Pakistan gets spirit “Saudi Economic Subsidies” and “Rising Sectarianism”

Pakistani Partnership Cemented (Saudi event)
“The Pakistani government is very excited over the recent agreement. Our own military is excited over the prospects of experienced Pakistani military personnel arriving to improve the defense capabilities of our forces. The Ministry of Information will soon spread word of the agreement to the local media and international press. We are expecting a positive response. The Pakistani agreement to defend the Kingdom from foreign aggression is also welcome news and will allow our leaders more leeway domestically. The agreement marks a new era in Saudi-Pakistani relations.”
-Excellent! (Saudi gets spirit “Pakistan Military Advisors” and Pakistan gains military access to the country, Pakistan guarantees Saudi Arabia)

Dealing with Bengali Anger (event from focus “PAK_Dealing_With_Bengali_Anger”)
“The recent shift towards a more Islamic identity, to better push our nation to the national ideology as laid by our founders has resulted in backlash from Bengalis in East Pakistan. Their provincial assembly, dominated by leftists has openly condemned the recent policies and call for Bengali independence. The President is going to Dacca in order to quell the tensions. Bengalis are a much more religiously diverse population and have followed the dangerous, secular ideology of the Awami League for decades. We will have to consider if a mutual separation would be for the best. However, a United Pakistan remains a strong Pakistan.”
-Seek a compromise (Leads to event “Preparations for Bangladesh”, then follow that event chain)
-United Pakistan (leads to event “Dacca Riots”, then follow that event chain)
