Defence Meeting in Delhi (event from IND_Defence_Meeting_In_Delhi)
India_Kashmir70s.50.d:0 "In a secret gathering of the top political, defence, and intelligence officers, discussion was held on what to do in Kashmir. The military presented that they had made the necessary logistical preparations for a campaign in Kashmir and our intelligence on the front was very high. They stated the decision now rested with the Prime Minister on whether military action is warranted. Local offensives could prove a powerful demonstration to Pakistan of our resolve, however, a failed operation could see the Pakistanis gain territory and prestige. If the Pakistanis appear too dug in or look like they may be considering their own offensive, the current operation can be transitioned from offensive to defensive. We must make a final decision."
-Leave the situation (8 year spirit "Kashmir Vigilance" improves defensive stats)
-Prepare for local operations (in 2 months India launches border war, event "India Launches Operations in Kashmir")

India Launches Operations in Kashmir (Pakistan/India) News Event
India_Kashmir70s.51.d:0 "The Indian Army launched offensives in Kashmir. The Indian government released a statement emphasizing the operations were limited and meant to punish Pakistan for its continued interference and provocations in Kashmir. The Pakistan government was quick to condemn the Indian attack and promised its forces would deliver a befitting reply to the Indian attack. The international community will watch the situation closely as there are fears any fighting between the two could quickly escalate into a general war."
-Situation deteriorating (starts border war)

Indian Forces Make Gains in Kashmir (Indian event if India wins border war)
India_Kashmir70s.52.d:0 "Our government announced it had successfully wrestled key border territories from Pakistani forces along the in Kashmir. The Indian Army recently launched its limited operations in response to Pakistani efforts to foment uprisings and to demonstrate the futility of military force for their forces. Parliament has already sent a note of congratulations to the government and military for its actions. The Pakistanis are dismissing reports they had suffered a defeat, but our troops are clearly in control of some key border areas. The international community is satisfied that the conflict did not escalate. The Indian people will view this success with great admiration."
-Excellent (gain some territories along the LOC in Kashmir, Pakistan gets event, "Setbacks in Kashmir")

Setbacks in Kashmir (Pakistan event)
India_Kashmir70s.53.d:0 "The Indian Army launched a nefarious scheme that culminated in their unprovoked aggression along the Kashmir border. Our forces fought bravely and with discipline, but were unfortunately pushed back in several sectors. We will condemn the Indian aggression internationally and minimize the losses to our people, but it is clear that the Indians stand in control of some new territories along the border. We must reassess our military situation and political direction in order to retake these territories and ensure no further acts of Indian aggression occur in the future."

Indian Forces Fail in Kashmir (Indian event if India loses border war)
India_Kashmir70s.54.d:0 "We have directed the Foreign Ministry and Defence Ministry to minimize its comments following confirmation from the Army our forces were pushed back slightly in Kashmir. Our plan to punish the Pakistanis and improve the military situation in Kashmir through a limited offensive failed. In the ensuing Pakistani counterattack, their forces managed to take some territory. Our plan has completely backfired, the Pakistanis and their agents in Kashmir will be emboldened for further aggression. The Indian military has pledged to be especially vigilant. We can expect public backlash and parliamentary anger over this failed operation, more significantly, the military situation in Kashmir has shifted."
-Oh no (Pakistan gains some territory along the LOC, Pakistan gets event "Indian Aggression in Kashmir Halted")

Indian Aggression in Kashmir Halted (Pakistan event)
"The Indian Army sought to use trickery and brute force to drive back our troops in Kashmir. Despite their efforts and surprise, our brave soldiers not only stopped their advance but also counterattacked, taking some key strategic positions along the border. We are already publishing pictures across the media of Pakistanis officers and soldiers posing on positions once occupied by the Indian Army. One advisor proposed a bold plan, we can offer to return the newly captured territory if India agrees to implement the UN Resolutions on Kashmir. India may now consider the military situation unsustainable and accept. The other option is to simply hold the territory and prepare for a future operation to completely liberate Kashmir."
-Ask India to implement UN Resolutions (India gets event, "Pakistan Offers Land for UN Resolutions")
-Keep our victories

Pakistan Offers Land for UN Resolutions (India event)
India_Kashmir70s.55.d:0 "The Pakistani government has offered to return the territory it seized in our recent border conflict In Kashmir in exchange for the implementation of the UN Resolutions on Kashmir. Hardline officials are urging us to reject the proposal, claiming we will be able to retake the lands in the future and an open vote would likely go against us. However, more moderate leaders believe this may be an opportunity to resolve our dispute with Pakistan in Kashmir. They believe we should trust our friends among the Kashmiris to vote with us and the implementation of the resolutions would likely not result in the complete loss of Kashmir. Another group of officials simply believe we should reject the proposal as that would set a precedent that states can blackmail us with territory to achieve goals. We must decide how to respond."
-Implement UN Resolutions (starts the UN Resolution chain from the 60s events)
-We will not be bullied
