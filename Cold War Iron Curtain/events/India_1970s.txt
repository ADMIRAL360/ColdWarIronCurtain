Defence Meeting in Delhi (event from IND_Defence_Meeting_In_Delhi)
India_Kashmir70s.50.d:0 "In a secret gathering of the top political, defence, and intelligence officers, discussion was held on what to do in Kashmir. The military presented that they had made the necessary logistical preparations for a campaign in Kashmir and our intelligence on the front was very high. They stated the decision now rested with the Prime Minister on whether military action is warranted. Local offensives could prove a powerful demonstration to Pakistan of our resolve, however, a failed operation could see the Pakistanis gain territory and prestige. If the Pakistanis appear too dug in or look like they may be considering their own offensive, the current operation can be transitioned from offensive to defensive. We must make a final decision."
-Leave the situation (8 year spirit "Kashmir Vigilance" improves defensive stats)
-Prepare for local operations (in 2 months India launches border war, event "India Launches Operations in Kashmir")

India Launches Operations in Kashmir (Pakistan/India) News Event
India_Kashmir70s.51.d:0 "The Indian Army launched offensives in Kashmir. The Indian government released a statement emphasizing the operations were limited and meant to punish Pakistan for its continued interference and provocations in Kashmir. The Pakistan government was quick to condemn the Indian attack and promised its forces would deliver a befitting reply to the Indian attack. The international community will watch the situation closely as there are fears any fighting between the two could quickly escalate into a general war."
-Situation deteriorating (starts border war)

Indian Forces Make Gains in Kashmir (Indian event if India wins border war)
India_Kashmir70s.52.d:0 "Our government announced it had successfully wrestled key border territories from Pakistani forces along the in Kashmir. The Indian Army recently launched its limited operations in response to Pakistani efforts to foment uprisings and to demonstrate the futility of military force for their forces. Parliament has already sent a note of congratulations to the government and military for its actions. The Pakistanis are dismissing reports they had suffered a defeat, but our troops are clearly in control of some key border areas. The international community is satisfied that the conflict did not escalate. The Indian people will view this success with great admiration."
-Excellent (gain some territories along the LOC in Kashmir, Pakistan gets event, "Setbacks in Kashmir")

Setbacks in Kashmir (Pakistan event)
India_Kashmir70s.53.d:0 "The Indian Army launched a nefarious scheme that culminated in their unprovoked aggression along the Kashmir border. Our forces fought bravely and with discipline, but were unfortunately pushed back in several sectors. We will condemn the Indian aggression internationally and minimize the losses to our people, but it is clear that the Indians stand in control of some new territories along the border. We must reassess our military situation and political direction in order to retake these territories and ensure no further acts of Indian aggression occur in the future."

Indian Forces Fail in Kashmir (Indian event if India loses border war)
India_Kashmir70s.54.d:0 "We have directed the Foreign Ministry and Defence Ministry to minimize its comments following confirmation from the Army our forces were pushed back slightly in Kashmir. Our plan to punish the Pakistanis and improve the military situation in Kashmir through a limited offensive failed. In the ensuing Pakistani counterattack, their forces managed to take some territory. Our plan has completely backfired, the Pakistanis and their agents in Kashmir will be emboldened for further aggression. The Indian military has pledged to be especially vigilant. We can expect public backlash and parliamentary anger over this failed operation, more significantly, the military situation in Kashmir has shifted."
-Oh no (Pakistan gains some territory along the LOC, Pakistan gets event "Indian Aggression in Kashmir Halted")

Indian Aggression in Kashmir Halted (Pakistan event)
"The Indian Army sought to use trickery and brute force to drive back our troops in Kashmir. Despite their efforts and surprise, our brave soldiers not only stopped their advance but also counterattacked, taking some key strategic positions along the border. We are already publishing pictures across the media of Pakistanis officers and soldiers posing on positions once occupied by the Indian Army. One advisor proposed a bold plan, we can offer to return the newly captured territory if India agrees to implement the UN Resolutions on Kashmir. India may now consider the military situation unsustainable and accept. The other option is to simply hold the territory and prepare for a future operation to completely liberate Kashmir."
-Ask India to implement UN Resolutions (India gets event, "Pakistan Offers Land for UN Resolutions")
-Keep our victories

Pakistan Offers Land for UN Resolutions (India event)
India_Kashmir70s.55.d:0 "The Pakistani government has offered to return the territory it seized in our recent border conflict In Kashmir in exchange for the implementation of the UN Resolutions on Kashmir. Hardline officials are urging us to reject the proposal, claiming we will be able to retake the lands in the future and an open vote would likely go against us. However, more moderate leaders believe this may be an opportunity to resolve our dispute with Pakistan in Kashmir. They believe we should trust our friends among the Kashmiris to vote with us and the implementation of the resolutions would likely not result in the complete loss of Kashmir. Another group of officials simply believe we should reject the proposal as that would set a precedent that states can blackmail us with territory to achieve goals. We must decide how to respond."
-Implement UN Resolutions (starts the UN Resolution chain from the 60s events)
-We will not be bullied

#News Event
Emergency Declared 
spirit "Emergency" severe penalties in terms of war support, stability and spirit "National Strikes" which hurts the economy)
India_Emergency.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her government gave permission for the President to proclaim a state of emergency across India. The government cited economic crisis caused by recent strikes over the recent political turmoil. The threat of renewed conflict with Pakistan was also cited as a reason for the emergency. This is an unprecedented change and is already causing opposition politicians to call for more strikes and resistance. The Prime Minister is accused of proclaiming the emergency to prevent her removal of power due to the Raj Narain verdict."

Bring the Courts to Heel (event from IND_Bring_The_Courts_To_Heel)
India_Emergency.3.d:0 "The courts recently confirmed the State of Emergency proclaimed by the Indira Gandhi government. Judges who did raise concern were superseded by pro-government judges quickly elevated above them. The courts are also approving arrest warrants by the government under the emergency. The continued effort of Indira Gandhi to replace and stack judges in her favor is being greatly criticized by the media and opposition. Regardless, the strengthening of the government control over the judiciary gives Gandhi immense power."
-Good (negative impacts of "Emergency" slightly reduced)

Proclaim Security Crisis (event from IND_Proclaim_Security_Crisis)
India_Emergency.4.d:0 "The Indian government has argued that there is an emerging security crisis necessitating the expansion and continuation of emergency rule. Indira Gandhi argues the rise in strikes and dissent, along with security concerns regarding Pakistan mean that India is facing an internal emergency along with a international one. The Prime Minister has requested the President to extend the emergency every six months until the situation has stabilized and democracy can flourish."
-Make the announcement

Public Becoming Convinced of Need
India_Emergency.5.d:0 "Despite vehement criticism from the opposition, it appears the government argument regarding the need for an emergency is gaining traction among the public. In recent weeks, more pro-government editorials and reports on the escalating security crisis are being widely read by the people. Indira Gandhi and her government appear to be stronger than ever, with extensive powers. The public is also expressed satisfaction with what they see is the arrest of corrupt politicians and officials by the government. The opposition will have to re-adjust its approach on confronting the government."
-Excellent (negative impacts of "Emergency" slightly reduced)

Major Newspapers Condemn Government
India_Emergency.6.d:0 "The major newspapers across India have launched a sustained editorial campaign criticizing the Indira Gandhi government. They point out the emergency appears to be the result of political setbacks not a real need to protect the nation. Many accuse the government of killing the democratic spirit of India. More troubling for the government is the publishing of opposition condemnations of the government. If the public supports the opposition, the Indira Gandhi government faces major challenges in maintaining the emergency."
-Oh no (negative impacts of "Emergency" slightly increased)

Inform the Army (event from IND_Inform_The_Army)
India_Emergency.7.d:0 "Indira Gandhi held a private meeting with the top officers of the Indian Army. She pointed out the reasons for the emergency and asked the military for its reaction to the situation. The Indian Army has a long history of being apolitical and professional, the Prime Minister expressed her hopes this would remain. The Indian Army and its top brass are faced with a difficult choice. While most officers are inclined to remain uninvolved, there are those who fear for the democratic future of the country. They urge the Army Chief to use his influence and suggest the Prime Minister consider ending the emergency and hold elections. However, to do so would be a major break from tradition."
-The Generals react…

Army Reaffirms its Apolitical Status
India_Emergency.8.d:0 "In a major victory for the Indira Gandhi government, the Indian Army declared it would remain apolitical. This is confirmation that the military is not being swayed by the opposition, though it is not likely to actively aid the government in cracking down on opponents. The military is strictly focused on protecting the borders from foreign threats. News of the Army refusing to act will reduce some of the tensions and provide a blow for those opponents who hoped for a military intervention to finally end the emergency."
-Excellent (negative impacts of "Emergency" slightly reduced)

Army States its Preference for Elections...
India_Emergency.9.d:0 "In a private meeting with the Army leadership, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was informed the military preferred elections. This marks a major setback for Indira Gandhi and the Emergency. The implication is a failure to call elections could result in either a military intervention or public refusal of military support, both disastrous scenarios for the government. Shortly after the meeting, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi addressed the nation and announced her recommendation the President lift the Emergency. New elections will be held immediately. The Army and government will not want to reveal the details of the meeting as that could disrupt the Indian political structure. If the opposition or general public found out it could lead to both anger at the Army for intervening and a new precedent that the opposition could call on the Army to resolve political problems in the future."
-Damn (election event and tree fire)

The Rise of Sanjay Gupta (Event from IND_Promote_Sanjay news)
India_Emergency.10.d:0 "Sanjay Gandhi, the son of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, continues to concentrate power during the Emergency. He was one of the strongest advocates for declaring an Emergency and with key advisors defecting to the opposition, his position has greatly solidified. The Prime Minister trusts her son completely, however, he is publicly perceived as corrupt due to his familial ties and previous involvement in controversial government initiatives. Sanja Gandhi has also unveiled a five-point agenda to promote efforts in improving literacy, family planning, among other social improvement initiatives. Many observers are nervous of the increasing prominence and power being held by Sanjay."
-Sanjay is ready (negative impacts of "Emergency" slightly increases)
-What could go wrong? (Rest of the world)

Appeal to the People (event from IND_Appeal_To_The_People)
India_Emergency.11.d:0 "Following the Emergency, the Indian government is seeking to break the traditional political machines operating across the country. Many regions of India are dominated by the political machines of mainstream political parties. This process prevents open competition in many areas and forces citizens to choose between voting for a party or losing access to state resources or bribes offered by the parties. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, under the urging of her son, Sanjay Gandhi, has begun dismantling these party machines through arrests and new regulations. This allows the Prime Minister and her supporters to directly engage with the population and not through the party apparatus, which consists of many opponents to the government."
-The people are thrilled (negative impacts of "National Strikes" slightly reduced

Unveil Twenty Point Program (event from IND_Unveil_Twenty_Point_Program news)
India_Emergency.12.d:0 "Prime Minister Indira Gandhi unveiled a Twenty Point Program in order to guide India out of its current crisis. The Prime Minister insists the implementation of the program will help guide the nation out of the current Emergency. The plan is focused heavily on the economy and is designed to boost the production of agriculture and the industry. Improving public services and rooting out corruption are also a major objective. The program is being well-received, however, the opposition are accusing the government of manipulating the people."
-Excellent (negative impacts of "National Strikes" slightly reduced

Arrest Dissidents (event from IND_Arrest_Dissidents)
India_Emergency.13.d:0 "Following the proclamation of the Emergency, the Indira Gandhi government has directed police across India to arrest dissidents. Perceived extreme political organizations, like the Indian Communist Party, the RSS, and Jamaat-i-Islami are finding their events being banned and leaders imprisoned. Activists discovered to be involved in organizing strikes or national protests are being arrested in the thousands. Even opposition politicians are being arrested on dubious charges of corruption and instigating unrest. There are widespread reports of police torture. Media outlets are said to be facing similar threats, with some media organizations becoming mouthpieces for the government. Although the government is removing its enemies, the public is said to be seething with what they see is an attack on civil liberties."
-We must remove dissidents

Unrest Intensifies
India_Emergency.14.d:0 "The efforts by Indira Gandhi and her government to restore order with a declaration of an Emergency faced a setback in Amristar. Thousands of Sikhs gathered in the city to condemn what they call the fascistic tendencies of the Congress Party. The event, called the Campaign to Save Democracy is being recognized as one of the first major mass protests against the government. The Indian government has already begun directing police to arrest Sikh activists. Despite being a small minority, it is clear that a large percentage of those arrested are Sikh, causing intense resentment from the Sikh community to the government."
-Oh no (negative impacts of "Emergency" and "National Strikes" slightly increases)

Unrest Decreases
India_Emergency.15.d:0 "Efforts by the Indira Gandhi government to directly engage with the population, bypassing traditional political infrastructures and new social reforms have gained traction among rural Indians. For urban Indians, there is still a great deal of resentment over what is seen as the erosion of Indian democracy. However, there is some support for the government among business owners who support new initiatives to revive the economy. The arrest of dissidents and crackdown on the opposition has hindered efforts to resist Indira Gandhi, overall the national strikes and protests have diminished."
-Excellent (negative impacts of "Emergency" and "National Strikes" slightly reduced)

Family Planning Campaign (event from IND_Population_Control_Campaign)
India_Emergency.16.d:0 "The government of Indira Gandhi is facing accusations of overseeing the forced sterilization of millions in the countryside. There are reports from villages accusing government doctors of sterilizing women without informing them. The current Family Planning campaign is believed to be under the control of Sanjay Gandhi and he is facing the brunt of criticism. There are protests across affected rural communities and newspapers are widely publicizing stories of individuals victimized by the program. Local officials are facing crowds of protestors outside their homes. Sanjay Gandhi is being accused of incompetence and corruption, with many believing his position is the result of nepotism."
-Oh no (negative impacts of "Emergency" and "National Strikes" increases)
