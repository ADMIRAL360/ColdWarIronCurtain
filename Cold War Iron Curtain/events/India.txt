Operation Nusrat (fires after PAK_Operation_Nusrat focus is completed)
Pak_India_War_65.1.d:0 "The Pakistan Army recently launched Operation Nusrat. Pakistani forces along the Kashmir ceasefire lines are conducting reconnaissance operations to find gaps and infiltration points along the border. Small incursions are also being launched to test response times and local civilian reaction to our movements. The knowledge we are gaining will be crucial in potential operations in Kashmir. It appears the Indians are not aware of the full extent of our operations. Our troops are highly motivated and confident, these operations are raising morale and experience."
-Good (national spirit, Operation Nusrat, increase in army intelligence, boost in attack, defense, morale, and organization)

Selecting Men for Operation Gibraltar (fires from PAK_Prepare_For_Operation_Gibraltar)
Pak_India_War_65.2.d:0 "After a series of high-level meetings involving senior officials from the cabinet and military, it was decided to reactivate Operation Gibraltar, a plan originally conceived in the early 1950s. The plan calls for the infiltration of Pakistani troops disguised as freedom fighters. These men would then conduct sabotage operations and encourage a popular uprising to end Indian rule in Kashmir. All of the soldiers involved are to be recruited from the Azad Kashmir Regiment. The plan is to conduct a month of specialized training before sending them over the border. Nine infiltration forces have been designated, each named after a famous figure from Islamic history."
-Operation Gibraltar will soon be ready (Launch Operation Gibraltar in 30 Days)

Launch Operation Gibraltar
Pak_India_War_65.3.d:0 "Columns of the infiltration forces crossed the border in Kashmir. They began moving to their planned areas of operations. However, the infiltration did not go as smoothly as we hoped. Some groups were discovered by locals who informed Indian authorities. They assumed our armed men, dressed as civilians, were armed criminals and not freedom fighters. Other forces are moving far slower to their areas of operations. Despite these setbacks, we have already received reports of some sabotage operations and armed clashes with Indian forces. Intercepted communications indicate the Indian Army believes an armed uprising maybe occurring. Ideally the locals will soon come to this conclusion as well and join in an uprising. Once the uprising begins in earnest our forces will advance to complete the liberation."
-It Begins [in thirty days the next event comes its either Operation Gibraltar Not Effective (75 percent chance) or Operation Gibraltar Very Effective (25 percent chance)]

Operation Gibraltar Not Effective
Pak_India_War_65.4.d:0 "Operation Gibraltar has not advanced the way we had hoped. Many locals have either stayed away from our fighters or have led Indian forces to their camps. Most of our infiltration groups have taken heavy losses, with some even retreating to the border. At this point the Indian Army clearly realizes they are facing our troops and not insurgents. There have been heavy fire fights and some sabotage operations but not to the extent we hoped. We may need to consider escalating to phase two with a direct attack along the border by our forces to save the situation and not lose momentum."
-Troubling News (in three days India gets Problems in Kashmir event)

Operation Gibraltar Very Effective
Pak_India_War_65.5.d:0 "WIP"
-Excellent News

Problems in Kashmir (Indian Event)
Pak_India_War_65.6.d:0 "Over the past few weeks our forces in Kashmir have engaged in heavy fighting against numerous groups of armed fighters. At first our local intelligence feared this was the beginning of an armed rebellion among the Kashmiris. However, it is now clear from the reports from locals and captured fighters that these are Pakistani regulars. We have two options in front of us, we can launch border offensives to punish the Pakistanis and take the fight to them. If we break through, we could improve our position along the ceasefire line and maybe even push for a resolution in Kashmir. The other option is to simply continue our operations to root out the infiltrators and restore normalcy in Kashmir as soon as possible."
-Launch the offensives (in a day, Pakistan gets "Indian Offensives on Kashmir Border"
-Focus on rooting out the insurgents (When Pakistan completes focus operation Grand Slam they will get the event "Operation Grand Slam")

Kashmir in Turmoil (Indian Event)
Pak_India_War_65.7.d:0 "Over the past few weeks, our forces in Kashmir have engaged in heavy fighting against numerous groups of armed fighters. At first our local intelligence feared this was the beginning of an armed rebellion among the Kashmiris. However, it is now clear from the reports from locals and captured fighters that these are Pakistani regulars. These infiltrators have caused extensive damage to the local infrastructure and we have troubling reports of some local Kashmiris joining the fighters. With the situation deteriorating we are left with two options. We can launch offensives along the ceasefire line to punish the Pakistanis and relieve pressure. The other option is to announce our support for implementing UN resolution 47 and hold a plebiscite."
-Launch the offensives (in a day, Pakistan gets "Indian Offensives on Kashmir Border")
-Announce the plebiscite (infrastructure damage in Kashmir, in a few days event "India Agrees to Plebiscite" end this chain and starting that chain, Operation Nusrat idea removed from Pakistan

Indian Offensives on Kashmir Border (Pakistan event)
Pak_India_War_65.8.d:0 "In response to Operation Grand Slam the Indian Army has launched offensives along the Kashmir ceasefire line. Our forces were caught off guard in certain sectors but are tenaciously resisting. With the grace of Allah, we will soon repulse this attack. Our commanders on the ground are confident that in time we will soon take the fight to the Indians and complete our mission to finally liberate Kashmir from its occupation."
-All will be well (India starts border war in Kashmir, if they win, Indian Forces Make Gains is fired, if not, Indian Forces Repulsed is fired)

Indian Forces Repulsed (Pakistan/India event)
Pak_India_War_65.9.d:0 "The Indian offensive along the ceasefire line has largely been repulsed by the Pakistan Army. Although the Indian forces appeared to make some initial gains, localized Pakistani counterattacks held firm. In particular, Indian forces appeared close to capturing the Haji Pir pass but were halted. Observers are watching the situation closely to see if Pakistan will launch its own offensive in response or work to cool down the escalating situation. This recent round of fighting was brought about after India discovered Pakistani troops were infiltrating into their controlled part of Kashmir to launch attacks. Both the United States and Soviet Union released statements calling for calm in the region."
-Keep the pressure on? (if focus Operation Gibraltar completed, event Operation Gibraltar fires, India gains national spirit "Kashmir setback" small drop in organization, morale, attack, and defense)

Indian Forces Make Gains (Pakistan Event)
Pak_India_War_65.10.d:0 "The Indian offensive along the ceasefire line in Kashmir is making dangerous gains against Pakistani forces. The Indian Army recently announced its forces were now firmly in control of the Haji Pir pass. This revelation marks a major setback for Pakistani forces and threatens Muzaffarabad. It appears these offensives are limited in nature and not an all-out assault on Pakistani controlled Kashmir. The Indian government reiterated that Pakistan must withdraw all its infiltration forces from Indian Kashmir and that the recent military action was a direct response to Pakistani aggression. The Pakistan government has remained largely quiet. There are fears of further escalation in Kashmir despite calls from the United States and Soviet Union for a restoration of peace."
-A befitting reply (Haji Pir Pass ceded to India, if focus Operation Gibraltar completed, event Operation Gibraltar fires, India gains spirit "Kashmir advantage" small increase in organization, morale, attack and defense, Pakistan loses spirit "Operation Nusrat"

Operation Grand Slam (if focus completed and one of the pre-request events has fired, Pakistan event)
Pak_India_War_65.11.d:0 "With Indian pressure mounting on the ceasefire line and in occupied Kashmir, the senior Pakistan Army commanders have planned Operation Grand Slam. This offensive will relieve pressure on our troops already committed to action and if it succeeds, we could potentially cut off India from occupied Kashmir. The thrust of the offensive will be directed to Akhnoor. If we seize the city, Kashmir will be cut off and our we can finally complete the liberation of Kashmir. The troops are positioned, and we just need to approve the operation to get it underway."
-Launch the operation (new border war launched by Pakistan, if it wins, Operation Grand Slam Makes Gains launches, if not, Operation Grand Slam Stalls follows

Operation Grand Slam Makes Gains (Pakistan event)
Pak_India_War_65.12.d:0 "Operation Grand Slam is making tremendous gains. Our forces are rapidly moving towards Akhnoor and once it is secured, we will be able to cutoff the Indian Army and even take Jammu. Reports from our officers on the front praise the effectiveness and morale of our soldiers. They believe once India is cut off, they will have to evacuate the Kashmir Valley or risk losing all its forces in Kashmir. The Air Force and Navy have gone on high alert, especially along the international border. However, latest intelligence reports indicate India will not likely escalate the conflict beyond Kashmir."
-On to Srinagar! (India gets Akhnoor Threatened, Pakistan should gain the territory west of Jammu in the map, threatening Jammu and cutting off easy access for Indian troops into Kashmir. Pakistan also should lose focus "Operation Nusrat". So maybe the map should be adjusted with an opening into Kashmir from the Pakistan bank of the Chenab River. Essentially, in the new map, I would like to see the region south of Poonch and west of Jammu, that is along the Pakistan border ceded to Pakistan, and their should be an opening from the Pakistan province bordering it that has a river bank with the Chenab river)

Operation Grand Slam Stalls 
Pak_India_War_65.13.d:0 "Operation Grand Slam has largely stalled. Our initial attack, especially the artillery, performed magnificently. However, our forces encountered difficult terrain and a much more tenacious defensive force than was expected. Although it is clear we are not threatening to cut India off from Kashmir, the offensive has succeeded in relieving pressure on our other forces and stabilizing the ceasefire line. Our men will fight on and hopefully a new opportunity will emerge. However, what is clear is that the situation in Kashmir is spiraling out of our hands rapidly."
-Hold firm! (Pakistan loses spirit Operation Nusrat, India gets event "Expand the Conflict Zone?")

Akhnoor Threatened: Expanding the Conflict Zone? (Indian Player)
Pak_India_War_65.14.d:0 "The massive Pakistani offensive towards Akhnoor caught our forces completely off guard. However, despite their superiority in numbers and equipment, our men are fighting bravely. The local commander says his forces can certainly hold the Pakistanis for several more days, however, he fears the size of the attacking force and does not feel he has enough reserves. The situation has left us with two options. One is to declare our intention to implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir and commit to the process. Although difficult, we may end up losing Kashmir but not on the battlefield. We can certainly find a moment to punish the Pakistanis later. The other option, by far the most popular one, is to expand the conflict and attack West Pakistan from the international border. This will relieve pressure and we can quickly seize the city of Lahore to use as a bargaining chip. The only other alternative is a military disaster in Kashmir."
-Expand the War (Leads to 1965 Indo-Pakistan War event)
-Inform the UN (launches event "India Agrees to Plebiscite" ending the chain for 65 War, Pakistan loses Operation Nusrat spirit and India loses Kashmir Advantage spirit, if not mentioned elsewhere, by the end of the Kashmir chain, before 65 War these spirits should be removed)
-Do nothing (leads to Pakistan Captures Kashmir Valley, do not know why player or AI would ever pick this, I guess if they are sick of Kashmir)

Pakistan Captures Kashmir Valley
Pak_India_War_65.15.d:0 "The recent Pakistani operations in Kashmir, from infiltrating guerrilla fighters and then launching a large offensive to cut off Indian forces has succeeded in securing the Kashmir Valley. When Pakistani forces finally cut off India from Kashmir, the Indian government came to an agreement. They would cede the Kashmir Valley, including Srinagar, to Pakistan and establish a new ceasefire line. In exchange, Pakistan guaranteed the swift evacuation and return of Indian forces along the old ceasefire line. Soon after the agreement, Pakistani troops reached Srinagar, where their supporters came out to support them. However, the celebrations occurred amid a background of not just Indian forces withdrawing but also minority families wishing to remain a part of India. The Indian government claimed it had no choice but are facing scathing criticisms from the opposition in parliament."
-Pakistan-Kashmir Zindabad! (event chain ends here, Pakistan gains Kashmir Valley, If it hasn’t happened, Pakistan loses Operation Nusrat spirit and India loses Kashmir Advantage spirit)

Expand the Conflict Zone? (Indian player)
Pak_India_War_65.16.d:0 "The Indian Armed Forces have thwarted the machinations of Pakistan and its military. Its efforts to spark an uprising and then seize Kashmir through armed force has been halted. Our forces possess the momentum. We can certainly halt the fighting here, leave the borders as is and hope Pakistan learns its lesson. However, many civilian and military leaders are now insisting we force a decisive resolution to ensure Pakistan never again considers such plans. They propose we expand the war across the international border in West Pakistan. If we quickly seize the important city of Lahore and press on in Kashmir, we can finally assert are status as the undisputed power in the region."
-Leave it as is (ends the chain, if operation Nusrat spirit for Pakistan or Kashmir Advantage spirit for India still around, should be removed. If the player picks this and Pakistan lost the Haji Pir pass, then they will get the event "Kashmir Debacle Assessed"
-Expand the war! (leads to 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, if operation Nusrat spirit for Pakistan or Kashmir Advantage spirit for India still around, should be removed)

1965 Indo-Pakistan War (India/Pakistan)
Pak_India_War_65.17.d:0 "The recent armed conflict in Kashmir has escalated into a full-blown war between India and Pakistan. Indian forces have reportedly crossed the border near Lahore and are rumored to be moving in other sectors. The Pakistani government released a defiant message to its population calling on its people to band together against the Indian invasion. The Indian government stated its operations were in response to the unprovoked violence unleased by Pakistan in Kashmir. They stated the Indian military would not rest until the Pakistani threat was neutralized."
-So it begins (India and Pakistan are at war, should immediately fire East Pakistan Theatre? event for Pakistan and Eastern Front? event for India. US should immediately get "Place Arms Embargo" event)

East Pakistan Theatre? (Pakistan Event)
Pak_India_War_65.18.d:0 "With war breaking out in West Pakistan, the command in East Pakistan must decide whether to active the theatre or not. The front with India is long and our forces present in East Pakistan are normally small. It may be better to keep our forces in their alert positions. If we do not show them aggressive intent, the Indians may choose to not make this front active as well. However, some officers believe we have adequate forces to not just hold our own to tie down Indian divisions but even launch offensive operations. We must decide what stance to take."
-Keep the front quiet (if India also selects this, then the event ���East Pakistan Front Quiet")
-Move to battle positions (Eastern front open, will lead to event, "East Pakistan Front Opens"

Eastern Front? (Indian Event, received once war breaks out)
Pak_India_War_65.19.d:0 "With war breaking out in Kashmir and along the West Pakistan border, our Eastern Command must consider its options. We can try to keep our forces in an alert position, but not with hostile intent. If the Pakistani forces reciprocate to this, we can keep the front quiet. This will ensure we can commit the maximum forces to the main front. Not engaging East Pakistan would also show our support to the Bengalis of Pakistan which may help us in the future. Some of our senior officers however believe we possess adequate forces to push deep into East Pakistan. They are pushing for us to open up this front and immediately prepare for operations."
-Keep the front quiet (if Pakistan also selects this, then the event "East Pakistan Front Quiet" is launched
-Move to battle positions (Eastern front open, will lead to event, "East Pakistan Front Opens")

East Pakistan Front Quiet (Global)
Pak_India_War_65.20.d:0 "Although India and Pakistan are engaging in open warfare in the west, both militaries have tacitly decided to not activate fighting along the East Pakistan border. Although the Indians and Pakistanis may be tempted to shift forces out of the area, as long as the war is raging, there is always the possibility that fighting can open up there. Many Bengalis in East Pakistan are not aware of this situation and there is a feeling of apprehension that they may be overwhelmed and left unprotected from a major Indian operation."
-All quiet on the eastern front (both Pakistan and India get a decision to activate the front, if selected, than East Pakistan Front Opens event fires. All the provinces along the East Pakistan border should be made into demilitarized areas to prevent fighting)

East Pakistan Front Opens (Global)
Pak_India_War_65.21.d:0 "The war between Pakistan and India escalated as fighting broke out between the two sides on the border with East Pakistan. Citizens in Calcutta and Dahka are reported to be stocking up on supplies. Blackout practices that have not been done since World War II are being brought back. Although both sides are promising a swift victory, it is currently uncertain who will have the upper hand in this area of battle. Volunteers on both sides are flocking to provide aid for their respective nation."
-Front opens (if demilitarized, those areas are now open, Pakistan gets spirit for three years, "Bengali Patriotism" which should give a small manpower and large stability boost for Pakistan)

Place Arms Embargo? (US Event)
Pak_India_War_65.22.d:0 "The situation in South Asia has escalated into an all-out war between India and Pakistan. Our diplomats and agents on the ground blame this fighting on Pakistan. This fighting is the result of recent Pakistani operations in Kashmir meant to force a resolution to the conflict. The State Department and intelligence community are livid. They believe Pakistan is using arms we provided to launch their operations and this conflict will only end up strengthening communism in the region. They are suggesting we announce an arms embargo on both India and Pakistan. Pakistan will be far more impacted by this. Some military experts however are urging caution and say we should not make such a rash decision. Pakistan is still a vital state for us."
-Impose Embargo (Pakistan gets event, "US Freezes Military Shipments", Pakistan focus "Demand American Resupply" is no longer available, India gets event "American Arms Freeze")
-We will let it play out (no change)

US Freezes Military Shipment (Pakistan event)
Pak_India_War_65.23.d:0 "The United States ambassador has informed us his government will soon announce a freeze of all military aid and shipments to Pakistan and India. They claim this is to prevent a further arms buildup in the region. The American ambassador also added the American government had always insisted its arms be used for the defense against communism and our use of American arms against India violated those terms. This is of course a big blow and preposterous. Our nation faces an invasion from a much larger neighbor, and we are entitled to use whatever weapons we have for the defense of the homeland. America has clearly shown their true colors."
-A big blow (Pakistan-US relations take a big hit, Pakistan gets spirit "US Arms Embargo" idk what effects this would have but this should ensure Pakistan no longer has access to Western Arms market

American Arms Freeze (Indian event)
Pak_India_War_65.24.d:0 "The ambassador of the United States informed our government there will be a freeze to all potential military aid or arms shipments to India and Pakistan. They claim this is to prevent a further arms buildup in the region. This news is no doubt a blow to Pakistan who have long been dependent on American arms. Our own military insists this news will not have a major impact. We responded to the ambassador by informing him it was the actions of his nation which emboldened the Pakistanis to act this way. Without American support, Pakistan would not have sought to upset the current situation."
-So what (India-US relations take a hit, India gets spirit "US Arms Embargo" idk what effects this would have but this should ensure Pakistan no longer has access to Western Arms market)

Pakistan Demands Resupply (US Event from Pakistan focus)
Pak_India_War_65.25.d:0 "As the fighting with India intensifies, the Pakistanis are demanding an immediate resupply of arms, tanks, and aircraft for their forces. They state the stress of open war is causing much wear on their equipment and they desperately need the support. The Pakistani military notes that India is cozy with Moscow and if Pakistan fails, Soviet influence in the region will be unchecked. The State Department finds the claims dubious but note American aid will certainly cement relations between us and Pakistan. Other senior officials suggest it would be better if we decline to involve ourselves in the conflict."
-Provide the arms (US-India relations hurt, leads to event in a week US supplies arrive)
-Politely decline (US-Pakistan relations hurt)

US Supplies Arrive (Pakistan)
Pak_India_War_65.26.d:0 "The United States has completed an emergency supply of arms to our forces. This equipment will go a long way in helping us out during this current struggle. The Indians were not happy about the rapid arrival of arms. Although we had asked the Americans for a much larger shipment of arms, considering the short notice, the military is very satisfied. The American action clearly shows they are true friends of Pakistan, and their action will not be forgotten anytime soon. The equipment is being quickly sent to frontline units."
-Thanks to Uncle Sam (Pakistan-US get a big relations boost, Pakistan gains 5000 small arms, 150 artillery, 75 mbts, and 50 Sabre jets)

Pakistan Mission to China (China Event from Pakistan focus)
Pak_India_War_65.27.d:0 "With the war reaching a critical level, the senior leadership of Pakistan made an emergency visit to us in order to gather support. We informed them that if they are worried of defeat, they should prepare for a peoples war and outlast their enemy. The Pakistanis politely took our advice but stated at the moment they needed our direct involvement. Our own experts suggest directly involving ourselves would not be a prudent. Instead we can offer either arms or vehemently condemn Indian aggression during this conflict."
-Offer Pakistan arms (Pakistan gets event, Chinese Weapons Arrive five days later, two days later, India gets event, China Condemns Indian Aggression)
-Condemn India (two days later, India gets event, China Condemns Indian Aggression)

Chinese Weapons Arrive (Pakistan event)
Pak_India_War_65.28.d:0 "Although China could not promise us an armed intervention during our current war with India. They have ensured an emergency shipment of arms reach our forces. Our military desperately needs all the support it can get. With this aid, China no doubt has shown itself to be a great friend of Pakistan. The equipment is quickly being processed and made ready for immediate use on the front. The war with India continues but with help like this, we hope to end it in a decisive victory for the people of Pakistan."
-Thank the chairman (Pakistan-China ties big boost, Pakistan receives 3000 small arms, 100 artillery, 50 mbts, 30 multirole fighters)

China Condemns Indian Aggression (Indian event)
Pak_India_War_65.29.d:0 "The Chinese released a troubling statement yesterday. They accused our government of naked aggression and imperialist designs on Pakistan. They insisted Pakistan was the victim of unlawful aggression and stated they were monitoring the situation closely. We have received reports of Chinese troop movements along the border. The implication appears to be that if we continue the conflict, China may choose to intervene against us. This is important to consider. However, several advisors dismissed the statement as bravado and insist China would not actually intervene. They argue China is just trying to show Pakistan its support without actually committing forces."
-China should mind its business (India-China relations take a big hit)

Pakistan Approaches UN (Comes from Pakistan focus, Pakistan event)
Pak_India_War_65.30.d:0 "The war with India has reached a critical level. Our top commanders and officials indicate the time is right to seek an end to the fighting. We will soon direct the relevant officials to approach the United Nations. We will ask them to facilitate a ceasefire with India and deploy observers to ensure the peace. We hope the Indians will quickly comply and this fighting can be halted as soon as possible. Regardless of the results, the people and armed forces of Pakistan have performed admirably."
-approach the un (in a day or two, india gets "Accept UN Ceasefire")

Accept UN Ceasefire? (India)
Pak_India_War_65.31.d:0 "The United Nations approached our government saying Pakistan was ready to declare an immediate ceasefire. The news is hardly surprising given the situation on the ground. The United Nations added in their communication that a ceasefire is the desire of the global community. We are meeting with our top military and government officials to assess the situation on the ground. Clearly the Pakistanis want an end to the fighting and we can agree to that. However, our diplomats said they could delay the ceasefire for a maximum of ten days before international pressure becomes too much. If we feel another ten days of fighting could benefit our final position, we can also do that."

Pak_India_War_65.32.d:0 "The United Nations approached our government saying India was ready to declare a ceasefire. This news is not surprising given the situation on the ground. The United Nations added in their communication that a ceasefire is the desire of the global community. We are meeting with our top brass and officials to assess the situation. We can certainly agree to the ceasefire now, which India is advocating at this stage. However, the Foreign Ministry believes we can use delaying tactics and delay a ceasefire for up to ten days before international pressure becomes too much. If we feel another ten days of fighting could improve our final position, we can also do that."
-Ceasefire now (immediately, UN Ceasefire Comes Into Effect)
-Delay Ceasefire (after ten days, UN Ceasefire Comes Into Effect)

UN Ceasefire Comes Into Effect (Global)
Pak_India_War_65.33.d:0 "A United Nations sponsored ceasefire has finally come into effect, at least temporarily halting the current Indo-Pakistan conflict. Both sides appear to be adhering to the ceasefire. The United Nations released a statement claiming with the fighting stopped, observers will soon arrive to help ensure there are no major ceasefire violations or territorial grabs by the two sides. The leaders of India and Pakistan are also expected to meet soon and seek to formally end the conflict. Many across South Asia can finally breathe a sigh of relief as this latest round of extensive fighting appears to be over."

Pakistan Post-War Assessment (Pakistan event)
"The Soviet Union has graciously offered to host peace talks in Tashkent to help end our war with India. As we prepare for the conference, we must consider what occurred during the recent conflict. Although our forces did not achieve decisive results, the Pakistan military held it own against a much larger enemy, no doubt impressing the world. During the conflict, both us and the Indians gained and lost territory during the fighting. The Foreign Ministry suggests we press India to implement the UN resolutions during the peace talks. They must surely recognize this is the only way to prevent future conflict with us. Our top diplomats, however, suggest the Indians will not likely accept this and the most basic result we can hope for is a return to pre-war borders. Considering how our war propaganda talked of great victories, event that result may lead to great disappointment."
-Preparing for Tashkent 

India Post-War Assessment (Indian event)
"The Soviet Union has graciously offered to host peace talks in Tashkent to help end our war with Pakistan. As we prepare for the conference, we must consider what has occurred. Our excellent armed forces successfully thwarted the Pakistani plot to seize Kashmir from us. Our forces then proceeded to punish the Pakistanis across their borders. Although we made gains, we also lost some territory to Pakistan. However, our top diplomats believe we achieved our goal of not losing Kashmir and we can likely negotiate a return to prewar boundaries. The Pakistanis are likely to push for a resolution to the Kashmir problem, however, they are not in a position to demand the territory or that we implement the UN resolution. The cabinet urges the Prime Minister not to cave to potential Pakistani pressures."
-Preparing for Tashkent (this plus Pakistan Post-War Assessment will lead in 60 days to event "Start of Tashkent Conference)

Bengali Resentment (Pakistan event)
"The recently concluded conflict with India has highlighted the anxiety and fears among many Bengalis in Pakistan. They felt the fighting in Kashmir occurred without consultation and resulted in a war that put East Pakistan in grave danger. In addition, many Bengalis felt the government focused its resources and troops on the Kashmir front, leaving the largest populated province of Pakistan vulnerable to enemy incursions. Bengali politicians and student leaders have addressed large crowds of protestors angry at what they felt was a failure of the military to protect them."
-Tensions rising (national spirit three years "Bengali Wartime Anxiety" small drop in manpower recruitment, drop in stability, removes spirit "Bengali Patriotism" if present)

Tashkent Conference Begins (global event)
"The Soviet government is hosting the leaders of India and Pakistan in Tashkent for talks. The purpose of these talks is to reach a final agreement to end the recent war fought between the two South Asian powers. The war began when Pakistan attempted to de-freeze the current situation in Kashmir, this led to a military escalation that culminated into open war. The Pakistani leadership will be pushing for a settlement on Kashmir, preferably the implementation of previous UN resolutions on the issue. However, experts believe the Indian government will likely reject such pressures and instead press to make the pre-war ceasefire line the permanent border. Many analysts believe the conflict on the ground was largely inconclusive and it would be surprising if either party could convince the other. For the Soviets, the meeting gives them a chance to demonstrate their claim of being a neutral or friendly world power to the newly emerging post-colonial states."
-The Conference Begins

Pakistan Calls for Kashmir Solution (India)
"The initial talks proved inconclusive, but following Soviet guidance, the Pakistani President and our Prime Minister to meet privately to discuss options for peace. During their talk, the Pakistani leader pressed us to implement the UN resolution on Kashmir and let the UN conduct a plebiscite. He stated that a failure to do so would only allow the conflict to fester and alienate the Kashmiris. After these talks, the Prime Minister discussed with his advisors. The consensus was that we remain firmly in control of our portion of Kashmir and should not legitimize Pakistani aggression by agreeing. Instead they stated we can offer to make the pre-war Kashmir cease fire line the permanent border. The Prime Minister heard these comments and must now decide whether he will go out on a limb and accept the Pakistani position or counter the offer."
-Accept the Pakistan argument (leads to India Accepts Pakistani Position)
-Make the counter-offer (leads to India Calls for Ceasefire line Being Made Permanent)

India Accepts Pakistani Position (India event)
"Against all his advisors, the Prime Minister announced his intentions to agree with Pakistan and implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir. He stated that though the decision will not be popular at home, it will cement India as a mature power and be viewed positively in time. He added the people of Kashmir may see the Indian decision as positive and this may make the vote end in our favor. The Pakistani delegation and the Soviet mediators were thrilled by this decision. The initial reaction from the media has been largely negative. Many opposition politicians and editorials are already lambasting the government for surrendering to Pakistani aggression, with some even calling for the government to resign. Despite this uproar, the Prime Minister remains committed to his decision."
-People will understand in time (leads to India Accepts Plebiscite event, rest of Tashkant Agreement tree does not fire at this point for Pakistan/India, ends the tree, India gains five year idea "Kashmir Betrayed" increase construction speed, drop in stability)

Breakthrough in Tashkent on Kashmir (global event)
"The international community was surprised to learn that India has agreed to approach the United Nations to implement resolution 47 and hold a plebiscite in Kashmir to determine its final status. Pakistan has long pushed for India to take this action and the recent war was largely fought to force a resolution on Kashmir. Although the military conflict ended inconclusively for Pakistan and many analysts predicted India would seek to restore the pre-war status quo. The United Nations have welcomed the decision, while nations across the globe are praising India for its statesmanship and desire for lasting peace in South Asia. The Pakistani government could barely conceal its glee over the announcement. The reaction in India has largely been of anger and shock at what many are calling a betrayal. To many Indians, they feel the decision is a concession to Pakistani military aggression."
-Hopefully we will have peace

We Have Achieved Our Objective (Pakistan event)
"The Indian Prime Minister informed us of his decision to implement the UN resolution on Kashmir. This marks the completion of our primary foreign policy objective since independence. We have long felt the need to de-freeze Kashmir, which pushed our recent actions. The Indian decision confirms that our actions were just, and the people of Kashmir will finally achieve their true rights after years of struggle. The initial reaction of the media and leading politicians has been largely positive. As news spreads, we can expect jubilant crowds. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and sacrifices of our armed forces in the recent struggle. We have truly emerged as a leading power in the region and the world."
-Pakistan Zindabad! (Tashkent Agreement tree will not fire, gain spirit, "Kashmir Success" five years, construction boost, and stability boost)

India Calls for Ceasefire line Being Made Permanent (Pakistan event)
"We tried to press India hard on taking this moment to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir. We hoped they would see from our actions and resolve that as long as Kashmir remained uncertain, there was no possibility of future peace. Instead, the Indian Prime Minister informed us that he agreed Kashmir should be resolved but the solution was not to surrender the decision to a foreign body like the UN. Instead, he suggested the pre-war Kashmir borders be restored and made permanent. This is a big blow to our cause and the consensus is to reject the proposal outright. However, the President must consider whether accepting the permanent border, and the negative consequences are worth the benefits of normalizing relations and establishing peace and prosperity in the region."
-Reject the idea
-We should accept for future generations (leads to Pakistan Accepts Our Proposal to India, Tashkent Agreement Tree for Pakistan/India will not fire)

Pakistan Accepts Our Proposal (Indian event)
"The Pakistani President, much to the chagrin of his advisors, stated his acceptance at making the Kashmir border permanent. In his comments, he noted this was done out of a desire for permanent peace for the people of Pakistan, India, and Kashmir. Our delegation, along with the Soviet mediators were jubilant with the decision and word is already spreading back home at our success. We are already receiving congratulations from opposition leaders over the success in Tashkent. We have decisively proven that naked aggression cannot lead to success and our armed forces sacrifices were for the greater good."
-Success! (Tashkent Agreement tree for India does not unlock, India gains 5 year idea, "Kashmir Success" stability boost and construction speed boost, launches event "Rage on Kashmir")

Rage on Kashmir (Pakistan Event)
"The reaction in Pakistan to the news in Kashmir has largely been one of disgust and outrage. During the recent conflict, the media portrayed Pakistan as achieving great military successes. Many are dumbfounded that after such supposed victories, how could the President surrender Kashmir. Many are claiming the battlefield victories have been surrendered in the peace talks. Already there are calls for solidarity marches for Kashmir to be held. Some members of the cabinet are expected to resign in protest, there are rumors of discontent within the ranks of the military as well. Regardless, the President remains firm and in a brief statement, mentioned the decision will lead to peace and open a path for Kashmiri families to be reunited."
-Eventually they will understand (spirit five years "Kashmir Betrayed" decrease in construction and drop in stability, spirit ten years "Military Discontent" drop in organization/morale, Tashkent Agreement tree will not fire)

Progress on Kashmir in Tashkent (global event)
"In a surprise breakthrough in Tashkent, the Soviet government announced Pakistan and India had reached an agreement on Kashmir. Both sides agreed to return to pre-war borders and make the original ceasefire line the permanent border. The news is being well-received internationally, with many praising the Pakistani government specifically for recognizing the situation astutely and achieving a permanent breakthrough. The recent war fought between both states largely occurred over fighting in Kashmir. Though the fighting remained inconclusive, it appears the Pakistani and Indian leadership were interested in firmly solving the crisis. The Indian population is reacting positively to the news, although initial reports from Pakistan suggest backlash at the agreement."
-Peace in South Asia?

Pakistan Rejects Our Solution to Kashmir (India Event)
"The Pakistani delegation flatly rejected our suggestion on making the Kashmir border permanent. Instead they reiterated their desire to implement the UN resolutions. It is clear that they are not willing to budge but are also not positioned to continue the fighting. We obviously cannot consider the Pakistani stance. Both us and the Pakistanis are facing intense pressure from the Soviet mediators to stabilize the situation. With the military situation ended inconclusively, it appears the only option left is to insist a return to the pre-war borders. Such a solution is not ideal, but will confirm that we succeeded in thwarting Pakistani aggression on Kashmir."
-Insist on pre-war borders

India Insists On Return to Prewar Situation (Pakistan Event)
"It is clear the Indians are not willing to budge or be realistic on a solution to Kashmir. In addition, we are facing immense pressure from the Soviets to wrap up the talks and agree to a solution that ends the recent conflict. The Indians have stated they will accept a return to pre-war borders and exchange of POWs. This is not the scenario we wanted, but given the situation, we do not have a choice. Our people must be satisfied with the result that despite facing such a large enemy, our brave military was able to prevent them from achieving a decisive victory."
-We accept (leads to event, "Zulfiqar Bhutto Lashes Out")

Zulfiqar Bhutto Lashes Out (Pakistan event)
"Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Bhutto, one of the more outspoken hawks within the government has reacted very negatively to the final agreement. He believes India will now act to make their occupation of Kashmir permanent and we should have continued the struggle. His loud denunciations are irritating to the President and it is likely that his days within the government are numbered. Privately, many within the cabinet believe Bhutto was instrumental in pushing the military to act on Kashmir and this action has led the government into the present situation."
-Who cares about this upstart? (Leads to event Agreement Signed for Pakistan/India)

Agreement Signed (Pakistan/India)
"With smiles from Soviet mediators, the Pakistani and Indian leaders signed the Tashkent Agreement. The treaty stipulates both sides will withdraw their forces to their pre-war borders. The agreement also pledges both sides to exchange POWs from the recent conflict. In regard to Kashmir, the agreement stipulated both nations would continue to work on finding an eventual solution. Though the Pakistanis did not achieve a permanent solution on Kashmir. India wanted language which pledged both sides to find a solution only through peaceful means, but Pakistan was able to make the language much vaguer. Overall, the agreement confirms the inconclusive nature of the conflict."
-Peace? (borders restored to pre-war boundaries, leads to event "Tashkent Agreement")

Tashkent Agreement Signed (global)
"After a week of negotiations in Tashkent, under Soviet mediation, Pakistan and India reached a final agreement. The Tashkent Agreement calls on a return to pre-war boundaries and exchange of POWs. Hopes for a final solution on Kashmir were not achieved as the agreement only urges both nations to continue talks. The agreement largely confirms the recent conflict was militarily inconclusive. The Indian delegation will likely be satisfied with the outcome, though the Pakistani delegation will likely face backlash. The international community has welcomed the agreement, hoping the restoration of peace in the region will pave the way for a future solution."
-Peace for a time

Prime Minister Shastri Dies in Tashkent! (Global event, fires if Shastri is Indian Prime Minister)
"In a stunning development from Tashkent, news reached that Prime Minister Shastri suddenly passed away soon after signing the agreement. Initial reports suggest he passed away from a heart attack. The Indian delegation and parliament are said to be stunned by the news. Prime Minister Shastri, known for his humbleness and quiet devotion to the Indian nation, had led the country ably during the recent war with Pakistan. The Pakistani President was said to be shaken by the news and helped carry his body to the plane returning him home for a proper funeral. Despite his death, the Tashkent Agreement and its implementation is not expected to be changed."

Pakistan Post-War Assessment (Pakistan event)
"We must prepare for negotiations with the Indian government in Lahore. The recent war with India ended with us achieving a strong military position. Through the grace of God, our armed forces achieved its objectives in Kashmir and along the border. The Indian military was unable to seize our major cities and suffered severe setbacks in Kashmir and elsewhere. Following the ceasefire, it was clear we are in a strong position to dictate terms to the Indians. Many in the cabinet are advocating we use our success to force India into settling Kashmir. We launched our operations in order to de-freeze Kashmir and have largely succeeded in our plans. Now is the time to press our claims."
-Prepare for Lahore (in a few days fires event "Rejuvenated Bengali Patriotism")

Indian Post-War Assessment (India event)
"We must prepare for negotiations with the Pakistani government in Lahore. The recent war with Pakistan did not go as we had hoped. Our forces suffered major setbacks in Kashmir and along the wider border. We failed to capture any valuable cities from Pakistan and cannot use that as a bargaining chip in the talks. It is clear the Pakistanis will press us on Kashmir and demand we vacate the province. Our best approach will be to push for the implementation of UN resolution 47. Ironically a reversal of our previous policy, if Pakistan instead pushes for us to vacate the province, we can then offer a partition plan that would allow us to hold on to Ladakh and Jammu. We must try our best in the upcoming talks to achieve an honorable result."
-On to Lahore

Rejuvenated Bengali Patriotism (Pakistan event)
"The Bengalis in East Pakistan have long harbored suspicions of being second-class citizens or being overlooked by the federal government. This despite their large population, huge economic role, and historical devotion to the Pakistan Movement. When war initially broke out over Kashmir, rumors spread that West Pakistan had abandoned East Pakistan. However, as the Pakistan military began achieving military victories, those apprehensions soon dissolved. The Bengali press praised the military successes, while the military and federal government offered their admiration to the support and sacrifices made by the people of East Pakistan. With the war over and peace talks about to commence, Bengali patriotism towards Pakistan appears renewed. To reciprocate this new feeling of unity, the Pakistan government announced the inclusion of a prominent Bengali provincial leader as part of the Pakistani negotiating team for the Lahore talks."
-Pakistan Zindabad (new national spirit "Bengali Patriotism" big stability boost, small construction boost for 3 years)

Indian Delegation Reaches Lahore (Pakistan/India event)
"The Indian delegation, headed by their Prime Minister, recently arrived in Lahore for talks on ending the recent South Asian war. The press noted none of the Indian representatives appeared anything but serious over their mission. Before arriving, the Indian Prime Minister informed his nation  that he was going to negotiate with Pakistan in the hopes of securing a just peace, the return of occupied Indian lands and soldiers being held as POWs. The Pakistani President and his delegation are already in Lahore, formal talks will begin in the next couple days. Although the Pakistani press had been noisily boasting over the successful position Pakistan is in, the government recently requested such writings be temporarily halted to facilitate a friendly atmosphere for the peace talks."
-Peace in Lahore? (couple days later, India Makes Kashmir Offer fires)

India Makes Kashmir Offer (Pakistan offer)
"During the initial talks, we told the Indians our principle objective was to establish a final peace in Kashmir. As we are in a militarily dominant position in Kashmir and along the border, we certainly have the advantage. However, the Indians surprised our delegation by offering to implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir, as we had demanded for years. They say now is the moment for both of our nations to step back and let the Kashmiri people choose their destiny. Certainly, this is what we have always wanted, but our position is such that we can simply demand India vacate Kashmir and not risk an international vote, which could potentially be interfered with by the Indians. We may never have such a strong negotiating position ever again and leaving it to the UN may backfire. However, accepting the Indian offer and then gaining Kashmir through a UN vote would make our success more legitimate internationally."
-Accept the Indian Offer (India gets "Pakistan Accepts Our Kashmir Offer")
-India must leave Kashmir (india gets "Pakistan Insists India Vacate Kashmir")

Pakistan Accepts Our Kashmir Offer (Indian event)
"In a surprising change of events, the Pakistani government accepted our offer to implement UN resolution 47. This result will leave the future of Kashmir to its residents and they may potentially choose to join us, though it appears unlikely. Regardless, this is a far more favorable result than being asked to completely vacate Kashmir. With this agreement, we can expect a return to pre-war borders on the international border along with a prisoner exchange, once we commit to the United Nations route. Rumors of the agreement are being well-received by the Indian press, with many seeing this result as far more palatable than the alternative."
-Best case scenario (event, "India Agrees to Plebiscite" fires, starting that event chain, also fires "Indian Offer Accepted in Lahore" for Pakistan, Treaty of Lahore FT options will not open for India)

Indian Offer Accepted in Lahore (Pakistan event)
"The Pakistani President addressed the nation with regards to peace talks in Lahore. He stated the Indian government had offered to wholly commit itself to implementing UN resolutions on Kashmir. He stated that empowering the people of Kashmir is the only modest desire of the people of Pakistan. The UN resolution will pave the way for Kashmiris to decide once and for all which nation they wish to join. The English press in Pakistan is praising the President for achieving Pakistani objectives in a way that does not humiliate India and preserve the international standing of the nation. The Urdu press, however, is much more scathing, accusing the government of picking international image over using their position of strength to force India out. For them, the Indians had years to implement the resolution but chose not to, they should have been humbled. There are also rumors within the military expressing disappointment that battlefield victories were not converted to a more concrete victory."
-The people will understand (leads to event "Kashmir Agreement Reached in Lahore", Treaty of Lahore FT options will not open for Pakistan, India-Pakistan borders restored to pre-war conditions as the Plebiscite event chain goes on to determine the final status of Kashmir)

Kashmir Agreement Reached in Lahore (global event)
"The world reacted positively to news that Pakistan and India had agreed to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir to establish a final resolution to the disputed territory. Indeed, the recent war fought between the two sides was over who controlled Kashmir. India was forced to offer the implementation of the resolutions as the military conflict left them in a very weak position. Because of this, the agreement surprised some observers who thought Pakistan would simply use its position to force India out of Kashmir and take it for itself. It appears the Pakistanis are working to not force a peace that would provoke further animosity from India or give an international image of Pakistan as a militarily aggressive power. It is also clear the Pakistanis were confident the vote will give Kashmir to them."
-Hopefully the UN will bring peace

Pakistan Insists India Vacate Kashmir (Indian event)
"The Pakistani government responded coldly to our offer to implement the UN resolution. They noted this was something we could have done years ago and to offer it now, with the current situation, it was a disingenuous way for them to save face. The Pakistanis instead stated that the Indian situation in Kashmir was clearly untenable and India should vacate the former Princely State. The Pakistanis softened this hardline stance by adding that if we comply, they will immediately restore the international border to the pre-war borders and exchange POWs. Certainly we cannot permanently accept the occupation of major Indian cities. However, some advisors suggest we offer the Pakistanis a partition plan for Kashmir in which we retain Jammu and Ladakh, this would allow each part of Kashmir to be with their co-religionists."
-Agree to Leave Kashmir (leads to Treaty of Lahore Signed)
-Offer a Kashmir Partition (leads to India Asks for Partition)

India Asks for Partition (Pakistan event)
"After we informed the Indians our intention was not to play games with regards to Kashmir, they made an intriguing offer. The Indians noted that historically Jammu was non-Muslim and the First Kashmir War drove many non-Muslims from the Valley to Jammu. That population would be apprehensive to a Pakistani government and to prevent animosity or a new cycle of communal unrest, perhaps we should partition Kashmir. They would give us all of Kashmir except for Jammu and Ladakh. Accepting this Partition Plan would achieve our goal of controlling the Valley and remove the potential headache of integrating Kashmiri non-Muslims. It would also avoid us inheriting the Indian border dispute with China. We should consider the option, however, some of the more hawkish delegates believe we should secure all of Kashmir and finally make Pakistan whole."
-Accept the Partition Plan (leads to event "Pakistan Accepts Partition Proposal" for India, Treaty of Lahore FT focuses will fire)
-Insist India abandon Kashmir (leads to event "Pakistan Will Not Budge" for India)

Pakistan Will Not Budge (Indian event)
"The Pakistanis have revealed their naked ambitions by rejecting our latest partition proposal on Kashmir. The Pakistanis have stated they will withdraw their forces from our territory and exchange POWs once our forces begin their evacuation from Kashmir. Our situation is untenable, the longer Pakistani forces occupy our lands the weaker the state and government look. Though it pains us, we have no choice but comply and sign the agreement. The military and population will no doubt be furious by this change of events. The Pakistanis are thinking very short sighted, though they may succeed now, the people of India will never abandon those Kashmiris we have protected since 1947."
-The struggle will continue (leads to event "Treaty of Lahore Signed")

Pakistan Accepts Partition Proposal (Indian event)
"The Pakistani government, after taking time to consider our proposal, have agreed to partition Kashmir. We immediately gave orders for our forces to withdraw to the new borders. The final agreement will see both of our nations return to the international pre-war borders and begin the process of exchanging prisoners. Although our people and the opposition will be disappointed with the result, we can at least argue that we have preserved our commitment to the victims of the initial tribal invasion of Kashmir. Given a bad situation, we have come up as well as could be expected."
-Peace for now (leads to event "Pakistan and India Conclude Kashmir Partition", pre-war borders are restored, except in Kashmir where India is only left with Jammu and Ladakh, Treaty of Lahore FT focuses will fire)

Pakistan and India Conclude Kashmir Partition (global event)
"The international community was pleased to see that Pakistan and India agreed on a final agreement to end their recent war in Lahore. After intense negotiations, Pakistan agreed to partition Kashmir with India. The Kashmir Valley and the territory already controlled by Pakistan will be under its control. India retains its control of Ladakh and Jammu. Both sides agreed this solution would allow all Kashmiris to reside where they are most comfortable. Despite this, there are already reports of non-Muslim Kashmiris moving to Jammu and India. This agreement marks a major setback for India and confirms their military defeat on the battlefield. For Pakistan, their government is celebrating the treaty as the completion of the nation. Plans are already underway for the President to visit Srinagar."
-Hopefully there will be peace

Treaty of Lahore Signed (global event)
"The President of Pakistan and Prime Minister of India signed the Treaty of Lahore to end their recent military conflict. The agreement confirms the Pakistani military victory as India agreed to withdraw completely from Kashmir. In exchange, both sides will return to pre-war borders along the international border and exchange POWs. The reaction in Pakistan has been complete jubilation. Mosques are proclaiming the details of the treaty, causing crowds to gather in celebration. In India, the treaty is being viewed as the ultimate humiliation. Reports are already arriving of non-Muslim Kashmiris fleeing to India, their arrival will only emphasize what was lost. Many observers believe despite the Pakistani victory, the situation between the two nations will not likely improve with this agreement."
-Peace for now (opens the Treaty of Lahore FT focuses for Pakistan, fires event "Indian Despair Over Treaty" for India)

Public Despair Over Treaty (Indian event)
"The Treaty of Lahore is being very negatively received in India. The opposition has been especially brutal in their criticism of the government in its handling of the war and its aftermath. There are reports of unrest among junior officers who feel the senior leadership and government failed the cause. There are some reports of civilians verbally abusing men in uniform and government officials. Of more concern is the arrival of pro-Indian Kashmiri refugees, their leaders are already publishing condemning editorials in major newspapers. We must work hard to reunite the nation and prepare for the future. Pakistan certainly had the upper hand this time, but we will no doubt eventually find our moment to strike."
-India Will Re-Emerge (new national spirit for 5 years, "Kashmir Lost" which will have negative construction, decrease in stability, and decrease production/efficiency)

#Treaty of Delhi chain
add_namespace = Treaty_Delhi
#Conditions required for Treaty of Delhi (India retains Srinagar, Jammu, Amristar, Calcutta, and controls Lahore or Karachi and either Dacca or Islamabad)

Pakistan Post-War Assessment (Pakistan event)
"The recent conflict with India ended disastrously. We not only failed to force India into resolving Kashmir but in the course of the conflict we now have Pakistani cities under Indian occupation. Militarily we have very little leverage. The people of Pakistan want their families united and their soldiers back home. However, it is clear the cost for this maybe at the expense of Kashmir. As our delegation prepares for Delhi, we must seek for a ceasefire and restoration of the pre-war status quo. If this fails, we will press for a partition of Kashmir with us retaining Gilgit-Baltistan. We will try to make that the permanent border to salvage at least something from the situation. However, the military situation is such that if India presses for us to vacate Kashmir, we will likely have no choice."
-We must trust in God

Indian Post-War Assessment (India event)
"The recent conflict escalated only after Pakistan launched a devious campaign of violence in Kashmir. Their efforts to forcibly seize the territory failed and in the resulting war our forces have proven superior. We have the military advantage and control enough territory to negotiate from a position of strength. Many of the hawks within the government will put pressure on us to demand all of Kashmir, including Gilgit-Baltistan. While this certainly makes sense, we have to consider the challenges in incorporating so much land and a population brainwashed for decades to hate our nation. It may be better to consider alternative plans but not squander the advantage our brave men secured for us on the battlefield."
-Prepare for our guests

Bengali Resentment (Pakistan event)
"The recently concluded conflict with India has highlighted the anxiety and fears among many Bengalis in Pakistan. They felt the fighting in Kashmir occurred without consultation and resulted in a war that put East Pakistan in grave danger. In addition, many Bengalis felt the government focused its resources and troops on the Kashmir front, leaving the largest populated province of Pakistan vulnerable to enemy incursions. Bengali politicians and student leaders have addressed large crowds of protestors angry at what they felt was a failure of the military to protect them."
-Tensions rising (national spirit three years "Bengali Wartime Anxiety" small drop in manpower recruitment, drop in stability, removes spirit "Bengali Patriotism" if present)

Pakistan Calls for Pre-War Borders (Indian event)
"The initial talks between us and Pakistan were very tense. During the most recent discussions they offered to return the region to the pre-war situation of one month before fighting began in Kashmir. They state this will preserve the delicate status quo of Kashmir and prevent further enflaming of emotions on both sides of the border. Obviously, this is a desperate ploy by the Pakistanis, we will soon inform the Pakistanis that it was they who upset the status quo. Because of this they must recognize the new reality on the ground, as such we will state that Pakistan must cede all of its occupied Kashmir to us. The Kashmir Princely State acceded to India and Pakistan must recognize this reality."
-Inform Pakistan of the facts

India Insists on all of Kashmir (Pakistan event)
"Our efforts at trying to restore the pre-war borders was soundly rejected. The Indians are in no mood to consider this. They feel like we caused the unrest and they cannot stop until they get something from us. Our next option is to trade our claim to the Kashmir Valley for a restoration of peace. We will propose a partition for Kashmir where we retain Gilgit and Baltistan but cede the rest to India. We have been defeated this time, but we will recover and never abandon Kashmir."
-Hopefully they accept this (India gets "Pakistan Asks for Partition")

Pakistan Asks for Partition
"The Pakistani delegation has realized we are not in a mood to let them off the hook. In the latest rounds of talk they have offered to cede their so-called Azad Kashmir to us but asked to retain Gilgit-Baltistan. During the First Kashmir War, Gilgit-Baltistan quickly fell to the Pakistanis as they had the support of local militia forces there. Their proposal may make a great deal of sense for us. We would avoid inheriting a hostile population and succeed in uniting the Kashmir Valley. Internationally it would also be a welcomed outcome. However, many of our hawks are saying we cannot lose this advantage and we should press the Pakistanis to leave Kashmir."
-We can accept this partition (Pakistan gets "India Accepts the Partition Plan")
-Pakistan must leave Kashmir (Pakistan gets "India Will not Budge")

India Accepts the Partition Plan (Pakistan event)
"The Indian government has accepted our proposal on partitioning Kashmir. With a heavy heart, we have already given orders for our officials and remaining troops to leave Azad Kashmir. Already there are reports of Kashmiri families fleeing to safety in Pakistan. However, considering the alternative, this was the best result. We will never abandon Kashmir however, our hands are tied. The Indian government has agreed to withdraw their own forces from our territory and exchange POWs and restore diplomatic ties. We can only pray the future will give us an opportunity to right this historical injustice."
-We Will Survive (pre-war borders restored, Azad Kashmir ceded to India, leads to event "Pakistan Public Disappointed")

Pakistan Public Disappointed (Pakistan event)
"News of our agreement in Delhi have led to mass agitation across our cities. There is genuine shock as many Pakistanis were under the impression our forces were doing well in the war. The early arrival of refugees from Azad Kashmir is fueling the anger. Within the military, there is rumors of tension between senior officers and their subordinates. Many young officers felt the military setbacks were due not to Indian superiority but a failure of leadership. We must work to reunite our people in this moment of crisis."
-Pakistan must Unite (gain spirit for 5 years, "Kashmir Setback" should increase construction time, drop stability, and decrease production/efficiency, opens Treaty of Delhi focuses for Pakistan)

The People Are Satisfied (India event)
"News reached the wider public of our agreement on Kashmir. Many in the country are jubilant with the result. They see the agreement as a confirmation of our military dominance of the region and a just punishment to the Pakistanis. In regards to Kashmir, many newspapers argue uniting the Kashmir Valley will unite families and reduce tensions among the Kashmiris. The military is being widely cheered for preserving the honor of the nation. With this victory, we hope to finally see a new era of peace."
-We are Triumphant (gain spirit for 5 years, "Kashmir United" decrease construction time, increase stability, and increase production/efficiency, opens Treaty of Delhi focuses for India)

Pakistan and India Agree in Delhi (global event)
"The negotiations in Delhi between India and Pakistan ended in an agreement. Pakistan agreed to cede the Kashmir valley to India, in exchange for a restoration of the pre-war international borders. The two sides also agreed to exchange POWs. Allowing Pakistan to retain Gilgit-Baltistan is being seen as a positive step by many observers. As the two sides withdraw their forces from the front, there are reports of Kashmiri refugees moving to Pakistan. The Indian population is said to be jubilant over the treaty, viewing it as confirmation of their military victory. The reaction in Pakistan is shock and anger, many feel the government completely failed the people of Kashmir."
-Hopefully there will be peace

India Will Not Budge (Pakistan event)
"The Indian delegation revealed their greediness and ambition by rejecting our just offer for a partition in Kashmir. The Indians stated the only scenario they will accept for a restoration of the international border and peace is our complete withdrawal from Kashmir. Due to the military balance, we are left with no choice but to comply. With a heavy heart, we must order our forces out of Kashmir. The consequences and backlash will be immense from the people. However, we have no choice, but considering the injustice of the situation, in time, we will be redeemed. Our delegates will soon sign the final treaty."
-Order the withdrawal (Pakistan cedes all Kashmir territory to India, pre-war borders restored everywhere else, leads to Pakistan event "Pakistan Despair Over Delhi Treaty)

The early arrival of refugees from Azad Kashmir is fueling the anger. Within the military, there is rumors of tension between senior officers and their subordinates. Many young officers felt the military setbacks were due not to Indian superiority but a failure of leadership. We must work to reunite our people in this moment of crisis. Our supporters now under Indian occupation will remain committed to us in their hearts."

Indian Jubilation Over Delhi Treaty

They see the agreement as a confirmation of our military dominance of the region and a just punishment to the Pakistanis. In regards to Kashmir, many newspapers argue uniting Kashmir Valley will unite families and reduce tensions among the Kashmiris.

The Indian population is said to be jubilant over the treaty, viewing it as confirmation of their military victory. The reaction in Pakistan is shock and anger, many feel the government completely failed the people of Kashmir."
