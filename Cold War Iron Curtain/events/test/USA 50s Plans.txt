USA_INDONESIA.5 America Calls for Humanitarian Intervention in Indonesia
"The situation in Indonesia has deteriorated as many patriotic Indonesians in Sumatra continue to oppose the government for its communist leanings. The government of Sukarno continues a heavy handed approach including cutting off essential supplies for those it accuses of rebelling. Under the advice of the CIA, the President has directed the State Department and United Nations mission to launch a diplomatic and public campaign calling for a humanitarian intervention in the conflict to prevent a massive loss of life. The CIA believes such a mission can provide an opportunity for us to expand contacts with the anti-communists and lay the groundwork for future action."
USA_INDONESIA.6 CIA Bomber Shot Down in Indonesia
"The CIA recently dispatched obscured bombers piloted by former Air Force pilots through a front organization called Civil Air Transport to support the Sumatra anti-communist rebels against the Indonesian government. These pilots were covertly launching bombing runs against Indonesian positions from rebel-controlled airfields. Unfortunately, the Indonesians shot down a bomber piloted by Allen Lawrence Pope. His B-26, after a bombing run was intercepted and shot down. Pope and a rebel crewmember managed to bail out but were captured by Indonesian forces. His capture confirms accusations by the government that rebel planes are being flown by American and Nationalist Chinese planes. We are denying involvement and claiming Pope was a mercenary, but the incident is a major embarrassment and we will end the operation."
USA_INDONESIA.7 Lessons from Indonesia (American CIA Failure Indonesia Summary)
"Our operation in Indonesia ended in failure, the anti-communist Sumatra rebels were defeated and Sukarno now appears to be in a much stronger position. The reasons for this failure are many, for one we underestimated the capabilities of the Indonesian military. Our efforts to support propaganda stations and rebel basis were thwarted by government attacks. The Indonesian military itself has many anti-communist officers and our actions risked turning them against us. The rebels and anti-communist factions were actually further divided by our actions to prop up the rebels, providing an opportunity to the communists to more closely align with the government. We also failed to shore up other Western powers and did not commit enough forces to ensure rebel success."
USA_INDONESIA.1 American Condemnation of Human Rights Abuses in Sumatra
"The United States condemned the human rights situation in Sumatra both at the United Nations and White House. The American government accuses the Indonesian government of using extreme violence and starvation against the people of Sumatra. This marks an internationalization of the recent rebellion of anti-communist Indonesian military officers who have seized Sumatra. The rebels are demanding the Indonesian government dissolve itself and ensure the removal of all communist influence from the nation. The Indonesian government so far has maintained control over most of the armed forces and its leader, Sukarno denies any alliance with communists or human rights abuses. Instead he says the rebels are a cabal of disgruntled men demanding power at the expense of Indonesian democracy. The United States action is being viewed with grave concern by other powers who fear American involvement may escalate the crisis."
USA_INDONESIA.8 American Naval Exercises off Indonesia
"The United States Navy has initiated large naval exercises off the coast of Indonesia and near Sumatra, where rebel forces are currently battling government troops. The United States has recently began criticizing the Indonesian government for its heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the rebels and refusing to listen to their demands. The rebels are demanding the Indonesian government, led by Sukarno, relinquish power and purge the communist party from any participation either in government or politics. The government denies excessive communist influence and accuses the rebels, consisting of military officers, of trying to undermine democracy to seize power. The American naval deployment and its criticism will only weaken the position of the Indonesian government and provide a strong show of support for the rebels."
INO_USA_WAR.1 American Intervention in the Sumatran Revolt
"In an address to the nation, the President of the United States announced American military forces were immediately deploying in Indonesia to protect the Sumatra rebels. The President noted the Indonesian government was using extreme tactics to end the revolt, needlessly putting millions of civilian lives at risk. He also stated the Indonesian government was increasingly falling under the thrall of foreign communist influence and the American intervention would not only save lives but save democracy for the people of Indonesia. The Indonesian government responded furiously, claiming the Sumatra rebels were simply a puppet force for the American government and that all Indonesians would unite to defeat the invading Americans."
INO_USA_WAR.5 The Partitioning of Indonesia
"The United States announced plans to partition Indonesia. The American government noted the current Indonesian state was far too diverse and spread out geographically to allow an effective central government. Such a system made it vulnerable to localized revolts and those living outside the main islands were prone to neglect from the center. With partition, all peoples on the islands will have access to a receptive government and no one island can impose its values or beliefs across all others simply because they control key state apparatuses. The decision is facing criticism among urban Indonesians, many of whom argue the partition plan will only provoke more conflict between the islands. Other argue the partition is really just a tool to ensure Indonesia never achieves its potential to become a major global player."
INO_USA_WAR.4 Evaluating Our Options in Indonesia (Whether to Reform the Central Government or Partition)
"With our successful intervention in Indonesia, we have the ability to dictate a resolution to the conflict. One option is to restore the central government and hand over power to the Sumatra rebel leader Colonel Ahmed Hussein. He will establish a strong regime and purge all communists from the country. Analysts believe his stance is popular among military officers. He could coordinate a robust, national anti-communist program. An alternative solution to Colonel Hussein is to partition Indonesia, as many analysts believe Indonesia is too large and geographically divided to be governed as it is currently. The unwieldly state apparatus makes Indonesia especially vulnerable to communist infiltration. Partition would prevent this and block a major avenue for communist infestation in the region."
INO_USA_WAR.6 PRRI (Colonel Hussein) Solidifies Power
"With American backing, Colonel Ahmed Hussein has solidified his control over Indonesia. Colonel Hussein came to prominence as one of the main rebel military officers in Sumatra. He delivered the ultimatum to the Indonesian government for the restoration of government officials and new elections. However, the government refused, resulting in an armed conflict. With American support, the rebels were able to triumph. He is expected to announce a cabinet consisting of the top national, anti-communist political leaders. His current military junta has several prominent and highly respected anti-communist officers. New elections are being promised, along with the banning of communists and other groups viewed as threats to the Indonesian state and democracy. The CIA and American embassy are reportedly playing a major role behind the scenes to protect the Hussein regime from counter-coups being planned by more senior officers."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.0 Involvement Hidden (Indonesian Bombing)
"The CIA, using a front company in Thailand has successfully been shifting bombers and pilots to support the Indonesian rebels in Sumatra. Our pilots have successfully been conducting strafing and bombing runs on Indonesian military targets and airfields. The bombers are slowly being transferred over to rebel pilots and it is clear our operations have not been exposed. We have managed to avoid exposure by the Indonesian government, allowing us to support the rebels and publicly remain a neutral party in the conflict. This will give us greater flexibility in pressuring Indonesia to stop its increasingly alignment with local communists."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.1 Bombing Program Exposed
"The CIA, using a front company in Thailand, had tried to clandestinely provide bombers and pilots to rebels in Sumatra. However, the Indonesian government has managed to shoot down a bomber and capture a pilot, exposing their origin. This is a major embarrassment for our government and a failure for the CIA. The Indonesians are furious and our reputation in the region will suffer as a result. It will require a lot of effort to re-establish trust with Indonesia. Along with the Indonesian government, the Soviet Union and regional communist parties are gleefully publicizing our embarrassment. The CIA director was given a dressing down by the President."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.2 American Bomber Shot Down over Indonesia?
"The Indonesian government has released news that an American bomber, flying for rebel forces in Sumatra, was shot down while attacking a government military airfield. The American Embassy quickly declined any involvement, however, Indonesian newspapers published photos of the downed airplane and an American pilot being held in custody. The downed plane, a World War II American plane, had Republic of China symbols under a recently applied fresh coat of plane. The Indonesian government noted the captured pilot, and origin of the plane indicated direct involvement from the United States. The American government now insists any American planes or pilots involved were mercenaries, not representatives or agents of the United States. Despite its claims, most nations appear to be siding with Indonesia and are calling for the United States to halt any assistance it is giving to rebel forces."
Sumatran_Revolt.50 The Indonesian Civil War (Sumatran Revolt Escalates into Civil War instigated by CIA)
"Indonesian rebels in Sumatra, mostly military units, recently started a revolt demanding the Sukarno government stepdown. The rebels believe communist influence in Jakarta is growing and Sukarno is falling to their influence. Efforts by Sukarno to resolve the issues and prevent an escalation have had some early success. However, the CIA believes with its backing, it can bring more support for the rebels and turn the revolt into a full-scale uprising against Sukarno. This would gravely weaken Sukarno and ensure help ensure the communists do not manipulate their way to power."

Establish_SEATO.1 Formation of SEATO
"During a Council of Ministers meeting in Bangkok, the Southeast Asia Treaty Association (SEATO) was formally established. The organization is a consequence of the recently signed Manilla Pact which called for its signatories to form SEATO in order to bolster bilateral ties and encourage collective security in the face of increasing regional communist aggression. The organization will be headquartered in Bangkok and hopes to attract more anti-communist regional states. The United States are major supporters of the effort and expressed hopes for the organization to emerge as a regional NATO. Although plans for cultural and military exchanges were discussed, the meeting did not agree on establishing any joint military commands. The Chinese government expressed reservations about the organization, calling it a pointless imperialist attempt to destroy the Chinese revolution."
Establish_SEATO.2 Invited to Join SEATO (Generic)
"The United States has offered us membership to SEATO. The organization is meant to strengthen bilateral ties between member states and coordinate collective security against Chinese aggression in the region. Joining the organization will provide opportunities to expand relations with those states, especially trade ties and cultural exchanges. Militarily, the organization does not have joint military commands but does hold regular meetings with senior defense officials which could give our armed forces professional development. However, joining the organization may make us a target of communist states. Our own domestic population may not be comfortable with the idea of collective security and oppose potential efforts to integrate the military responses of the group."
Establish_SEATO.3 Generic Response to America to Join
"[Nation] has accepted our invitation to join SEATO. They have pledged to attend the next Council of Ministers meeting to formalize its membership. They have informed us the organization aligns with their foreign policy and objectives. They were particularly excited about the prospect of increasing cultural and trade ties with the other member states. This is a major victory for our foreign policy and SEATO will benefit from its newest member. The response from the press is very positive as many in the country see the growth of SEATO as confirmation of our robust foreign policy."
Establish_SEATO.4 Generic Response to America to Decline
"[Nation] has declined our invitation to join SEATO. They claim discomfort over the prospect of being so closely linked with the organization along with domestic concerns. It was iterated that the rejection of membership did not mean a rejection of our position or friendship. [Nation] has determined joining the organization would potentially cause more problems than benefits. This is a setback for sure, but we will continue to look for potential new members to strengthen the defense against the looming threat of communism in Asia."

CENTO_PROPOSAL.1 American Proposals to Expand CENTO 
"The United States recently proposed expanding the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is designed to contain communist influence in the middle east. Its members enjoy increased bilateral ties and better access to Western aid. The American proposal would seek to bring in more middle east states and strengthen CENTO to face not just communist threats but also other radical ideologies in the region. Its legitimacy as a regional alliance would be strengthened. Pro-American Arab states will be targeted to bring more Arab states to the organization. Bringing more Arab state will also quash accusations the organization is not representative of the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.2 (to Lebanon) Join CENTO?
"We recently received an invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is meant to be a middle east version of NATO and prevent communist expansion in the region. The United State and Britain provide military and economic aid to the group. Members enjoy increased bilateral and cultural ties. Joining the organization could increase access to Western aid. It would solidify our place in the Western camp. However, joining the organization could have domestic ramifications and radicalize both leftists and Arab nationalist in the country."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.3 Lebanon Declines to Join CENTO (Local)
"The Lebanese government has declined membership to the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Lebanon stated they respected the invitation and carefully considered it. However, due to domestic concerns and the feelings of the Lebanese people, it must decline. This is a major blow for the United States which hopes to expand CENTO in order to bring more Arab states to better respond to radical ideological threat to the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.4 Lebanon Joins CENTO (Global)
"The Lebanese government announced its excitement to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Joining the organization will bring Lebanon access to more Western aid. Lebanon expressed its hopes of expanding bilateral and cultural ties with all member states. CENTO and the United States view this as a major victory, Lebanon brings one of the largest centers of Arab culture in the organization, providing CENTO greater legitimacy in the region. Arab states in the region are condemning Lebanon and accusing it of betraying the Arab people for an imperial puppet alliance."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.5 Lebanon Joins CENTO (American)
"Lebanon responded positively to the invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). This is a great victory for the organization which we helped setup in order to contain communist influence in the region. Though the organization was meant to promote collective defense in the region but has not really gotten beyond being a forum for closer bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges. With Lebanon joining the organization, it will quiet regional criticism of the group being an imperial project promoted by us and Britain. It will also give the organization a stronger ability to deal with the rise of more radical ideologies in the region, like Arab nationalism."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.6 (to Jordan) Join CENTO?
"We recently received an invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is meant to be a middle east version of NATO and prevent communist expansion in the region. Britain and the United States provide military and economic aid to the group. Members enjoy increased bilateral and cultural ties. Joining the organization could increase access to Western aid. It would solidify our place in the Western camp. It could strengthen the pro-Western inclinations of the monarchy, however it could backfire and radicalize both leftists and Arab nationalist in the country, especially in the military."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.7 Jordan Declines to Join CENTO (Local)
"The Jordanian government has declined membership to the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Jordan stated they respected the invitation and carefully considered it. However, due to domestic concerns and the feelings of the Jordanian people, it must decline. This is a major blow for the United States which hopes to expand CENTO in order to bring more Arab states to better respond to radical ideological threat to the region. For Jordan, it will likely strengthen its image among Arab nationalists both domestically and in the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.8 Jordan Joins CENTO (Global)
"The Jordanian government announced its excitement to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Joining the organization will bring Jordan greater access to more Western aid. Jordan expressed its hopes of expanding bilateral and cultural ties with all member states. CENTO and the United States view this as a major victory, Jordan brings one of the more influential Arab states in the organization, giving CENTO greater legitimacy. Arab states in the region are condemning Jordan and accusing it of betraying the Arab people for an imperial puppet alliance and bribes."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.9 Jordan Joins CENTO (American)
"Jordan responded positively to the invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). This is a great victory for the organization which we helped setup in order to contain communist influence in the region. Though the organization was meant to promote collective defense in the region but has not really gotten beyond being a forum for closer bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges. With Jordan joining the organization, it will quiet regional criticism of the group being an imperial project promoted by us and Britain. It will also give the organization a stronger ability to deal with the rise of more radical ideologies in the region, like Arab nationalism."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.10 America Joins CENTO
"The United States accepted an invitation to officially join Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) and no longer be an observer. This gives the organization much greater access to Western aid and reduces the burden on Britain to meet the needs of CENTO. The CENTO members are said to be thrilled with the announcement and look forward to hosting senior American officials in future conferences. For the United States, a strong CENTO will protect its interests in the region and provide it a strong alliance to combat anti-Western or communist-friendly regimes. Critics in the region are condemning the action, calling it proof that CENTO is an imperial project. Joining the organization will lessen the need to support Israel directly to achieve our objectives. Our membership may help transform the organization into a true NATO for the middle east."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.11 America Declines to Join CENTO
"The United States has declined an invitation to upgrade its status from an observer to a member of the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Although the organization is meant to defend the middle east from communist encroachment, it has struggled to evolve beyond a forum of bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges among members. In the wider middle east, the organization is seen as an imperial project. The State Department is not confident our membership will evolve the group and in fact worry it will further erode its legitimacy in the region. Israel has also not been particularly fond of the group and pro-Israeli officials note supporting Israel will be a far more effective way to achieve regional objectives. For these reasons, the United States decided not to join."

CIA_SYRIA.1 Operation Straggle Overview
"Recently the CIA held talks with a former Syrian minister, Michail Bey Ilyan, over the prospect of an anti-communist coup in the country by the military. He stated that military units could seize control of Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, and Hamah along with all major international border crossings. Once radio stations announced a new government, under Colonel Kabbani, the leading anti-communist civilian politicians would be called to serve the new government. The plotters would need cash from the CIA to pay off relevant officers and ensure success. The CIA supports the plan, calling it Operation Straggle, they believe an anti-communist Syria would shore up anti-Soviet resistance in the region. Diplomatic advisors are not supportive, believing the operation may enflame tensions and cause instability in Damascus, which the communists could then exploit."
CIA_SYRIA.2 Executing Operation Straggle
"CIA agents in Damascus have worked furiously to ensure the relevant cash drops were made to support Operation Straggle. Over a hundred thousand dollars has been spread in support of Straggle. The State Department is prepared to release statements and diplomatic maneuvers to protect and support the new regime following the coup. However, tensions in the region with Israel forced the Syrian orchestrator, Michail Bey Ilyan to postpone the plan for five days. The CIA is urging Ilyan to not delay any further as the moment may be lost. Washington is waiting nervously to see if the planned coup occurs."
CIA_SYRIA.3 Coup in Syria (Global)
"Reports from Damascus are sketchy, Syrian military vehicles were spotted moving across the city, securing key buildings and the state radio station. Similar reports have arrived from Aleppo. Travelers trying to enter or leave Syria from either the Jordanian or Lebanese border are being forced to turn around as the military appears to have closed the borders. Radio broadcasts are declaring a new government will be forming under Colonel Kabbani, indicating a coup is occurring. The next few hours will determine exactly has occurred in Syria overnight."
CIA_SYRIA.4 Failed Coup in Syria (Global)
"The Syrian government announced plans for a coup sponsored by the United States had been uncovered by Syrian intelligence. Syria released pictures of arrested conspirators and showed the assembled media piles of cash said to be provided by the CIA. The Syrians claim it was patriotic officers who turned the conspirators in and halted the American attempt to rob the Syrian people of their independence. The United States has denied involvement in any plot. The coup apparently envisioned the Syrian military overthrowing the government and establish a new regime around Colonel Kabbani, who is among the detained."
CIA_SYRIA.5 CIA Backed Coup (Syrian Perspective)
"The new regime of Colonel Kabbani is already enjoying international legitimacy, especially from the United States which was quick to recognize his government and push its allies to do the same. The American embassy has also been active, with rumors that senior officers are being paid cash to not challenge the new regime. The recent announcement of a new cabinet, consisting of anti-communist politicians has further confirmed what many Syrians understood from the beginning. This coup is a CIA-sponsored operation. The new regime will have to work quickly to establish itself among the people as many Syrians view the regime with contempt."
CIA_SYRIA.6 Failure of CIA Backed Coup (Syrian Perspective)
"Our intelligence interrogations reveal the extent of American involvement in the recently uncovered coup plot. It appears senior American agents plotted and passed huge amounts of cash right under our noses. American support was based almost solely on the promise the new regime would be firmly anti-communist. It is distressing to see how far the United States would go in their plots, but fortunately, their allies were spineless and incompetent to our own agents. We will spread word of this American plot and the Syrian people will rally behind us as true defenders of the Syrian people."
CIA_SYRIA.7 Analyzing Our Failure (Giving up on Syrian Regime Change)
"The failure of Operation Straggle reveals fundamental issues with American involvement in Syria. The CIA recognizes it was over trusting of its Syrian contacts and overvalued their capabilities. The Syrian intelligence apparatus is incredibly robust and difficult to outmaneuver. In addition, Syrian nationalism is a very powerful force, and the CIA thought cash bribes would overcome such loyalty. They were wrong as once officers realized where the money came from, they moved quickly to expose the plot. Incredibly, some officers we bribed went to the government, confessed, and turned over the cash. The exposure of our involvement also greatly weakens American prestige in the country and continued involvement will only stoke Syrian paranoia of the West. We must focus our efforts to overt diplomacy and engagement with friends in Syria instead of covert options. If not, we risk more failures like Operation Straggle."
CIA_SYRIA.99 Syria a Danger to Regional Stability?
"The CIA has used its contacts with media across the world and political allies to release articles highlighting how unstable the Syrian government is. These reports note the Syrian government remains committed to war with Israel and is engaged in arms building at the expense of developing its economy and government for the benefit of its people. More significantly, Congress has been informed of intelligence reports indicating growing communist power in Damascus. These reports suggest either a communist coup may occur in the near future or the unstable Syrian regime may turn to the Soviet Union, opening its lands to communist military bases and troops in exchange for arms. The public is increasingly viewing Syria as an unstable bomb on the verge of destroying any semblance of regional or global peace."
CIA_SYRIA.100 Join the American Coalition?
"The American government has invited us to join their international coalition against the Syrian government. The Americans claim the Syrian government is unstable and that It is bent on expansionism. Whether at the expense of its public enemies or Arab neighbors. On top of that, the Syrians continue to maintain territorial claims on almost all its neighbors. The United States would like us to help them end the Syrian regime to restore peace in the region and end the recent history of political instability in the country. Our advisors believe participating may open up opportunities with the Americans. However, a number of officials caution us to reject as joining the anti-Syria coalition may alienate our population who will likely see the war as an American adventure."
CIA_SYRIA.101 American Lead Coalition Invasion of Syria
"The United States announced its coalition has commenced military operations against Syria. The Americans insist the Syrian government is unstable and a risk to its own population and all its neighbors. Disarming the regime and installing a government for all Syrians is the only way to prevent a catastrophic regional crisis from emerging. The United States promises a swift coalition campaign, but the Syrian government remains defiant and calls on all Syrians to unite in opposition to the foreign invaders."
CIA_SYRIA.25  America Calls for Humanitarian Aid to Turkey
"The United States has called for an international effort to provide humanitarian aid to Turkey. Recent unrest in northern Syria has seen large numbers of refugees cross the border into Turkey. The Turkish government recently called the situation on its border a humanitarian disaster. Turkish troops have deployed in the region to control the flow of refugees and support refugee camp construction. The American government also levied heavy criticism on the Syrian government for its heavy handed approach."
Syria_CIA.27 America Recognizes Turkish Annexation of Northern Syria
"The Secretary of State stated the United States recognized the recent annexation of northern Syria by Turkey. The Secretary noted Turkey was forced to act only after the Syrian government exasperated the situation with a brutal crackdown of civilians in the area. The United States believes the arrival of Turkish forces will halt the violence and prevent the situation from deteriorating further. The Syrian government has condemned the United States for undermining its sovereignty and openly backing the dismemberment of the Syrian nation. Syria calls on all Arabs to come together and liberate Arab lands seized by the Turks."
Syria_CIA.26 American Endorsement of Turkish Intervention in Syria
"Turkey recently asked for our reaction if they were to intervene in Syria. The Turkish government noted the humanitarian situation in northern Syria was rapidly deteriorating, causing a refugee crisis and bringing armed fighting right on their border. The Turkish military believes it can swiftly intervene and end the brutal Syrian campaign. The American President responded by endorsing such an intervention, the United States believes the conduct of Syrian forces, so they are unfit to govern the territory. The American government will provide Turkey all diplomatic and intelligence support it can for its operations."
CIA_SYRIA.50 (To Turkey) America inquires into Syrian Schemes
"The United States has dispatched some envoys to privately ask for our views on Syria and a plan they have developed. The Americans believe northern Syria is unhappy with Damascus and their agents can foment an uprising. In the ensuring chaos, the Americans would ask us to intervene and occupy northern Syria with full support and international protection from the United States. With American backing, such a plot could see us in control of strategic territory and resources. However, any military operation comes with unforeseen risks and we may risk facing stiffer Syrian resistance or a wider Arab backlash if we go along with the American plan. We must make our decision on whether to support the scheme to invade northern Syria or decline."
CIA_SYRIA.51 Turkey Agrees
"Turkey has indicated it is willing to work with the United States on a plan to deal with the Syrian regime. They have promised to deploy forces and help build the case for a Turkish intervention once the uprising in northern Syria began. Turkey also pledged to share its own intelligence and assets in the region to aid the American effort. This is a major diplomatic victory. Once Turkey takes over the Syrian territory, Syria will be reduced to a rump state and will no longer pose a threat to the region."
CIA_SYRIA.52 Turkey Declines
"The Turkish government has declined to support plans with the United States to instigate a popular uprising in northern Syria to setup a Turkish takeover of the area. The Turks believe the plan is not realistic and would weaken the regional position of Turkey and risk a prolonged, bloody conflict with Syria. This is a major setback for American plans to weaken the Syria and remove them as a regional threat. The Turkish government also noted though it would not support the plan, it hopes to maintain friendly ties with the United States."
CIA_SYRIA.53 (To Iraq) America inquires into Syrian Schemes
"The United States sent intelligence operatives to privately present our government with a proposal. They believe the Syrian government and state poses a risk to regional security and American interests. They would want us to launch an invasion of Syria and restore Hashemite rule the area. To support the endeavor, they will provide extensive diplomatic cover and provide military arms to our forces. Their intelligence agencies will also aid in establishing a pretext for an Iraqi intervention. The plan is attractive in that it would right the wrongs endured by the late King Faisal and firmly establish our place in the region. However, many advisors fear such an intervention could alienate the Iraqi people and Arab nationalists in the military. We must decide how to respond."
CIA_SYRIA.54 Iraq Agrees
"The Iraqi government has agreed to support our plans for overthrowing the Syrian government. The Iraqi government and intelligence agencies will cooperate with ours to facilitate the transfer of arms and a pretext for an Iraqi advance into Syria. The Iraqis are very attracted to the idea of expanding Hashemite rule in Syria and curtailing the spread of Arab nationalist ideas. They are adamant the pretext be made undeniable in order to strengthen the government when it decides to intervene. American diplomatic and clandestine support is also greatly appreciated. The plan will hopefully end the Syrian threat once and for all."
CIA_SYRIA.55 Iraq Declines
"The Iraqi government declined to support our plan for overthrowing the Syrian government. The Iraqis believe the scheme is not realistic and its potential rewards do not outweigh the potential negative outcomes. The Iraqis fear a prolonged conflict with a fellow Arab state. However, the biggest concern is that even with a strong pretext established, Arab nationalists in Iraq and the military may instead use the conflict to seize power from the monarchy. The Iraqi decision is a major setback to American efforts to deal with Syria and the risks it poses to the region."
CIA_SYRIA.10 Operation Wappen
"The CIA initiated contact with senior Syrian right-wing generals, under the leadership of General Adib Shishakli. He has a history of being friendly with the West and promises a return to such policies along with a crackdown of Syrian communists. Our Syrian friends believe a coup can be done but for a price. Syrian commanders, troops, and officials will have to be bribed to ensure support for the proposed coup. The CIA is confident the plan will work as General Shishakli has national recognition and experience at the highest levels. The proposed operation is being called Operation Wappen."
CIA_SYRIA.11 No Price too High? (Debating how much to use in bribes, lowball it and no coup attempt)
"The CIA has presented the final plan for Operation Wappen. The Syrian generals have asked for much more cash than originally agreed upon The White House is concerned throwing so much cash in Damascus may expose the plan and hints that this may just be an attempt to extort us. Of more concern is that this is a Syrian sting operation meant to expose our involvement and damage our reputation in the region. The CIA is strongly encouraging we meet the demands, but the Secretary of State believes they are suffering from tunnel vision and desperation to engineer a regime change. We must decide to meet the exorbitant demand, offer the original amount, or cut our losses and not risk exposure."
Passage_to_Freedom.0 America Launches Operation Passage to Freedom
"The United States Navy announced the initiation of Operation Passage to Freedom. American forces will help the French Army and French Navy evacuate pro-French and anti-communist Vietnamese civilians trapped in communist North Vietnam to the safety of non-communist South Vietnam. In particular, the campaign is focusing on evacuating Catholics in North Vietnam who face the threat of an atheistic regime and hostile propaganda that they are a pro-French fifth column. The CIA is secretly working with the South Vietnamese government to produce and spread leaflets in North Vietnam urging Catholics and others to flee the communist regime. The current government in South Vietnam desperately wishes to bring more Catholics to bolster a government heavily reliant on Catholic officials. North Vietnam has condemned what they call hostile propaganda, though there are reports of river traffic, roads, and villages being cut off from major cities to block the flow of refugees."
CIA_SYRIA.12 Generals Accept the Bribes (Coup Proceeds)
"The CIA has successfully dispersed cash bribes to key Syrian generals and it appears Operation Wappen is ready to go. The coup leader, General Shishakli is said to be organizing right wing political parties to prepare them in anticipation for the coup. Once the generals seize power and purge leftist officers, the new government will need the support of the right-wing parties to successfully govern. The CIA reported its confidence to the White House that the Operation will occur soon. It also noted the successful bribery campaign indicated American economic power can be effectively used to achieve intelligence objectives, when the situation was right."
CIA_SYRIA.13 Generals Reject the Bribes (Historical)
"The CIA suffered a major setback following news reports from Damascus that several Syrian generals had turned in bribe money they claimed was given by the United States to launch a coup. Syrian forces surrounded our embassy and detained the CIA officer orchestrating the plot on the ground. The generals claimed their patriotism and loyalty to Syria pushed them to report the incident and turn in the cash. Operation Wappen has been exposed, along with CIA participation. Other Syrian generals and political leaders involved either fled abroad or were detained by Syrian intelligence. It appears our bribe offers were not high enough for several generals who chose to expose the plot rather than risk a failed coup. The White House is said to be furious while the State Department suggests that Syrian intelligence had known the entire time and only struck now to maximize the embarrassment for the United States."
CIA_SYRIA.14 The Generals Coup (Global News Event for Syrian Coup)
"Overnight, Syrian tanks and troops swarmed across Damascus, seizing the radio station along with key government buildings. Similar scenes occurred in Aleppo and several other major Syrian cities. The next morning, state radio broadcasted that a council of generals had seized power and overthrown the government for its corruption and betrayals of the Syrian people. By that evening, the exiled General Shishakli arrived by plane to take control of the junta and government. The new Syrian leader addressed the population and called for national unity and a purging of dangerous, foreign ideologies like communism from the country. The United States and Britain were quick to welcome the new government, while Arab nationalists in other parts of the region staged protests."
Syria_CIA.10 American Invasion of Syria
"The United States announced it was commencing military operations against the Syrian government. In recent weeks, the CIA has used its media contacts to publish reports linking massive Soviet arms transfers to Syria. They also wrote articles describing the Syrian government as a Soviet client fomenting unrest in the region and brutally repressing the people. This has led to public outcry and a demand for action to halt Syrian aggression in the region. The President stated the American armed forces would act to liberate the Syrian people."
