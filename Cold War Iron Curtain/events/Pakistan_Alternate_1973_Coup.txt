#1973 Coup (If Mujibur Rehman leader from 1970 Democratic Election Tree

Military Launches Surprise Coup (event fires if it is 1973, Mujibur Rahman is President in the Democratic Route)
"Pakistanis woke up to the sight of troops and tanks across cities in West Pakistan and in some cantonment areas in East Pakistan. Government buildings were occupied while reports indicate the homes of leading politicians are currently surrounded by troops. Other politicians are said to be under house arrest. Soon after, the Army announced it had taken control of the country from President Mujibur Rahman. The leader of this coup is a young Major General named Zia ul-Haq. It appears the coup was planned below the upper echelons and it is rumored these senior officers area also under detention. In his statement, President Zia stated the nation was being moved towards atheism and provincial politics which would lead to the destruction of the nation. General Zia promised new elections would be held soon. However, it is unknown how much control the military has in East Pakistan where much of the forces there are Bengali."

Hold Talks with Awami League (event from PAK_Hold_Talks_With_Awami_League)
"In the aftermath of the military coup, the situation in Pakistan is at a tense stalemate. West Pakistan is largely under the control of the military, who enjoy support from the conservative and religious segments who long opposed the move towards socialism in the country. Within the military, Zia has garnered support among much of the officer corps who oppose the rise of alternative military forces. However, the Awami League managed to retain control in East Pakistan as the Bengali forces within the Army refused to join General Zia. With the situation at a stalemate, General Zia dispatched a group of officers and political allies to Dacca for talks with the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman."
-Hold talks (in a week, get event "Reach Agreement with Awami League")

Reach Agreement with Awami League
"After intense negotiations, the Awami League and military government announced an agreement had been reached. Out of respect for the sentiments of West Pakistanis and East Pakistanis, it was agreed that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Awami League will remain in control of East Pakistan and the military would not try to seize control of the eastern wing. The Awami League agreed to allow the military regime to govern West Pakistan until a final agreement can be reached. Essentially both sides agreed to maintain the status quo. Most Pakistanis appear to have accepted the situation, hoping civil war can be avoided."
-At least it is not war

Hold Talks with Bhutto (event from PAK_Hold_Talks_With_Bhutto)
"Following the agreement with the Awami League and its essential removal from West Pakistan, Zulfikar Bhutto is by far the most popular politician in the country. General Zia recently sent representatives to Bhutto asking for his intentions. A defiant Bhutto mentioned his disapproval of the coup and called for the restoration of democracy. General Zia and his top generals must decide if they should allow Bhutto to leave his current house arrest and setup a constitutional assembly for the country. He would create a new constitution that preserves the Islamic principles of the country and end provincial conflicts. Bhutto could be convinced to keep Zia as Army Chief and not target the coup leaders if given power. The other option would be to keep Bhutto detained and investigate him for alleged corruption charges as the military government continues to govern."

PAK_Bhutto_Assembles_Constitutional_Assembly
"Following his release from house arrest, Zulfikar Bhutto called on all political parties to come together for a constitutional assembly. The Pakistan Army is currently standing down, lifting martial law regulations and returning control to local civil authorities. Bhutto is calling for a new constitution that will resolve the outstanding issues and prevent the disunity that prevails across the country. To establish a united Pakistan, Bhutto has invited the Awami League to attend and politically reunite the two wings of the country."
-Invite the Awami League (leads to event, "Awami League Refuses to Attend Constitutional Assembly")

Awami League Refuses to Attend Constitutional Assembly
"The Awami League shocked the nation by refusing to attend the Constitutional Assembly called for by Zulfikar Bhutto. They note Bhutto appears to be a military puppet and they how a leader of a minority party could be in charge of constitution meeting. This announcement has thrown a wrench at plans to unite Pakistan. Efforts by Bhutto to negotiate have failed and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced he would no longer accept the continued oppression of Bengalis. It appears the Awami League is now determined to achieve self-government for East Pakistan. Protests have erupted across East Pakistan with the people demanding independence and the withdrawal of the Pakistan military. Pakistani forces in East Pakistan are said to be staying in their barracks and minimizing contact with the broader public."
-Oh no (leads to event, in 45 days, "Military Announces Withdrawal Plans")

Military Announces Withdrawal Plans
"The Awami League refusal to attend the constitutional assembly caused a stalemate with Zulfikar Bhutto in control of West Pakistan and Mujibur Rahman in charge of East Pakistan. To break this stalemate, and end the increasing feeling of despair among Pakistanis, the Pakistan military announced plans to withdraw its forces from East Pakistan. This paves the way for a full separation. Those military personnel who wish to remain in East Pakistan will be allowed to stay on. However, the Army announced it would withdraw all equipment not nailed down from East Pakistan and call up reserves to replace those officers and troops who stay behind. Over the years a number of Bengalis have joined the military with many already stationed in East Pakistan, they will likely stay. Experts believe once the military completes the evacuation, separation will follow."
-A new erea (leads to event, in 90 days, "Bangladesh Declares Independence")

Bangladesh Declares Independence
"Addressing a crowded stadium, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed the independence of Bangladesh. Across Dacca and what is now the former territory of East Pakistan, millions are said to have taken to the streets, with almost every home flying homemade Bangladesh flags. Later on, Rahman met with senior government and military officials from Pakistan who formally congratulated the people of Bangladesh and promised a new era of brotherly ties. Despite this public display of acceptance, both Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are bitter over this separation, with many blaming the other side for failing to compromise or make the decisions necessary to preserve Pakistan."
-A new era (Bangladesh gains independence)

Corps Commanders Meeting (event from PAK_Corps_Commanders_Meeting)
"With Zulfikar Bhutto under arrest and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman still in control of East Pakistan, General Zia ul-Haq called a Corps Commanders Meeting to discuss the situation. During the high-level discussions, Zia was presented with two options on how to deal with the rising unrest, especially among urban leftists and Bhutto sympathizers. Once these groups are handled, then the government can deal with Mujibur Rahman and East Pakistan. One option calls for an aggressive military crackdown. The generals nickname it the stick approach. The other option is to offer concessions and compromise with the major political groupings in the country in order to govern in cooperation."

Bring Charges to Bhutto (event from Pak_Bring_Charges_To_Bhutto)
"The military government announced it would soon bring charges related to corruption and murder against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. This stunning news comes months after the major political leader was put in house arrest following a military coup by the Pakistan Army. Bhutto managed to release a written statement condemning the charges as trumped up and without merit. He called for the people of Pakistan to continue resisting anti-democratic forces and save the country. When asked about the charges by the international media, General Zia stated he had no comment as the judiciary is not under his influence. He stated the courts of Pakistan and the rule of law will determine the fate of Bhutto. There are reports of hit and  run attacks against military patrols in Karachi, sparking rumors of armed resistance..."

Final Status of East Pakistan (event from PAK_Final_Status_Of_East_Pakistan)
"The Pakistan government under General Zia announced it had reached an agreement with the Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Zia recently sought to depose Rahman in a military coup, but the Bengali leader managed to escape to Dacca and take control of East Pakistan. The two sides agreed to exchange government and military personnel, this will allow East Pakistani residents living in West Pakistan to return home, and vice versa. It also calls for the complete withdrawal of Pakistani military equipment from the country, General Zia insists this belongs to Pakistan. After the equipment and personnel are exchanged, Pakistan will accept the independence of Bangladesh. Many across both West and East Pakistan welcome the news as they are fed up with the constant political conflicts and disorder."
-Announce Evacuation Plans (leads to event "Pakistan Announces Evacuation Plans")

Pakistan Announces Evacuation Plans
"Pakistan confirmed its commitment to its recent agreement with Bangladesh by publishing its evacuation plan. Military personnel and government officials wishing to be repatriated back to Pakistan are to do so as soon as possible. The government is also dispatching and hiring transportation services to ensure the speedy removal of military and state equipment purchased for the state of Pakistan. The government claims it will complete the evacuation in roughly three months. The Pakistan government, responding to criticism that it is leaving nothing for Bangladesh, noted it would hire and arrange the evacuation of East Pakistanis wishing to leave West Pakistan during this same period. General Zia expressed his desire for future brotherly ties."
-Next is Bangladesh (leads to event, in 90 days, "Grant Independence to Bangladesh")

Grant Independence to Bangladesh
"General Zia signed a document with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dacca confirming the independence of Bangladesh. The two men, former rivals who had engaged in months of political stalemate, warmly embraced each other after the signing. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman expressed his joy for the people of Bangladesh, though he noted it took much hardship for it to happen. General Zia simply expressed his desire for both nations to continue on the path of Islam and the vision of Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The next day, the two men were to meet for talks and General Zia must decide if he will take the opportunity to offer Bangladesh an alliance, or to just leave the situation as is."
-Offer Alliance (Bangladesh independent, Bangladesh gets event "Pakistan offers Alliance")
-We go our separate ways (Bangladesh independent, end chain)

Pakistan Offers Alliance (Bangladesh event)
"During private talks held between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Pakistani leader General Zia ul-Haq, the Pakistani strongman called for the two sides to sign an alliance. Zia noted Pakistan and Bangladesh are both descendants of the Pakistan movement and their people should maintain close ties. Although a unified state is not possible, a new friendship based on mutual respect and independent development could make the two states the powerhouse alliance in the region. Rahman thanked General Zia but stated he must discuss the matter with the cabinet. The response from the cabinet appears to lean towards rejecting the offer. They note General Zia was the one who sought to overthrow the Awami League which led to these current circumstances and fear the people would feel betrayed. Others however, especially those connected to the religious parties, note such an alliance could confirm Bangladesh has a major place both regionally and internationally. Mujibur Rahman must decide how to respondâ€¦"
-Accept (alliance with Pakistan)
-Reject (ties with Pakistan hurt)
