Dealing with the Western Border (Event from PAK_Dealing_With_Western_Border)	Ayub_Afghanistan.1
“Afghanistan has always threatened the unity of our nation. Since independence they constantly stir up Pathan nationalism through their Pashtunistan campaign. In addition, they have continuously refused to recognize our border along the Durand Line. Over the years we suspect they have not only been spreading propaganda but also engaged in clandestine and overt efforts to stir an armed uprising. So far our forces have remained vigilant to the threat. However, the status quo is no longer acceptable, especially as we have other security concerns to deal with. We have two options on Afghanistan. We can either open a dialogue and strengthen bilateral relations, or we can respond to Afghan aggression with our own hardline and force them to the peace table.”

Pakistan Proposes Talks (Afghanistan event, event from PAK_Propose_Afghan_Talks)
“The Pakistani government has invited us for talks in Peshawar. From media reports and discussions with their ambassadors, it is clear the Pakistanis are seeking to hold an olive branch to us. Although there are some hardliners who advocate we reject the talks as long as Pashtunistan is not on the agenda, doing so will likely alienate non-Pushtoon leaders in the country. They are increasingly criticizing our government for what it calls an obsession with Pashtunistan which has cost the nation dearly in terms of trade. We will send a delegation but the highest-ranking member of it will be the Foreign Minister, this way we can keep both the hardliners and moderates happy. The hardliners will like the idea of not sending more senior officials, while the moderates welcome the possibility of peace talks. The talks will take place in a week.”
-Cautiously Optimistic
Afghan-Pakistan Talks in Peshawar (Pakistan/Afghanistan event)
“The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan arrived in Peshawar to hold talks with senior Pakistani leaders over the outstanding issues between both states. The Pakistani government gave the visiting Afghans a large reception and provided tours for the first few days, including a tour of the famed Bala Hissar Fort. This visit did result in a small gaffe as the Afghan media criticized the Foreign Minister for visiting the former royal residence of the Afghan monarchy that is now headquarters to what Afghanistan terms an occupying military force. Despite these minor issues, the talks have now started and the Pakistani government has not hidden its hopes that a breakthrough can be reached.”
-The talks begin (Afghanistan gets “Pakistan Offer More Open Borders” in 2 days)
Pakistan Offer More Open Borders (Afghanistan event)
“The Pakistani government noted that it considers the Durand Line to be the official border of both nations, despite the criticism of Afghanistan. However, it also noted that at independence, Pakistan made it a point to withdraw permanent military outposts from the Tribal Areas to respect the autonomy of its tribes. The Pakistanis state this demonstrates their desire for peace in the region and respect for the peoples living on the border. In fact the Pakistanis have offered to further loosen border restrictions on the border to allow Afghan and Pakistani families separated at the border to more easily travel to one another. On the surface the proposal appears very sound and would benefit Afghani families. Signing the agreement appears very beneficial, especially if we want peace eventually. However, some in Kabul worry the proposal is a steppingstone for the Pakistanis to lull Afghanistan and eventually have us accept the Durand Line.”
-Accept Proposal (leads to event “Pakistan-Afghanistan Agree to Looser Borders”)
-Reject Proposal (Leads to event “Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End in Failure”)
Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End in Failure (Pakistan/Afghanistan event)
“The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan informed the Pakistani government that the proposal on looser borders was unacceptable. The Minister insists the only solution to the crisis is the removal of Pakistani forces from Pashtunistan and a referendum for the people to decide. With no progress in sight, the talks were quickly concluded. Many in Pakistan are disappointed over the failed talks, with some opposition leaders openly criticizing the President for his failure in resolving tensions with Afghanistan. Regardless, the government feels it had to try and hopes in time the Afghan government can see reason. In Kabul the hardliners praised the government for its firm stance, while moderates voiced criticism over the inflexibility shown during the negotiations.”
-Rats (chain ends, Pak-Afghan relations drop)
Pakistan-Afghanistan Agree to Looser Borders (Pakistan/Afghanistan event)
“In Peshawar, representatives of the Pakistani and Afghan government signed an agreement to loosen border restrictions in order to facilitate travel between families that are separated by the border. For Afghanistan, the agreement will provide relief to many of its citizens who have bitterly criticized border restrictions for years. In Pakistan, the agreement is seen as an act of political maturity from the government and an indication of its desire to have peaceful relations with Afghanistan. However, there are some critics to the agreement. Hardliners in Kabul accuse the government of betraying the sacred pledge for Pashtunistan while in Pakistan some have expressed concern that more open borders could lead to Afghan infiltration in the country. Regardless, the majority of people in both nations appear satisfied with the agreement.”
-Excellent (big boost for Pakistan-Afghanistan relations)
Pakistan Offers to Hold Referendum on Durand Line (Event from PAK_Offer_Vote_On_Durand_Line, event Pakistan-Afghanistan Agree to Looser Borders must have occurred as well)
“Following our successful agreement with Afghanistan on looser borders, relations are positive and we are in a good position diplomatically. Some officials believe now is the time to offer a referendum on Pashtunistan for the people of the Tribal Areas, not the North-West Frontier Province or areas of Baluchistan. Although the Afghans argue the referendum should be done by a neutral party, we can simply say that as no military outposts are present in the Tribal Areas, there can be no fear of intimidation. We will even offer to sign a binding agreement with Afghanistan to respect the results. At the very least Afghanistan will appreciate the gesture, and if they accept, we are confident the Tribal Areas will remain in Pakistan.”
-Propose the Referendum (event “Pakistan Offers to Hold Referendum” in a couple days)
-No need to press our luck (end chain here)
Pakistan Offers to Hold Referendum (Afghanistan event)
“In an extraordinary proposal, the Pakistani government has offered to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan. However, there are some caveats, they have limited only to the Tribal Areas and will administer the referendum themselves. This proposal shows at the very least a desire from the Pakistanis to listen and can be appreciated. Indeed, moderates and some hardliners within the government urge us to accept the proposal. If the Tribal Areas vote to join Afghanistan, it very well may lead to public pressure in Pakistan to expand the referendum to the NWFP and Baluchistan. Many hardliners and some moderates however, disagree. They see the offer as disengenous and a ploy to try and weaken our position on the issue. They insist Pakistan would not accept the vote unless they knew they could win. Instead they argue we should at the very least accept the gesture in good faith, but decline as it does not cover all of Pashtunistan.”
-Accept the offer (leads to event “Afghanistan Accepts Our Offer”)
-Reject the offer (leads to event “Afghanistan Appreciates, but Rejects Our Offer”)
Afghanistan Accepts Our Offer (Pakistan event)
“Kabul informed our Foreign Minister they have accepted the offer to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan in the Tribal Areas. We have already sent out an announcement on the vote which will take place in about 90 days. The reaction in Afghanistan is mixed, with some calling it the first step to liberation while others arguing it is a Pakistani ploy. Preparations are already beginning as we dispatched instructions to Political Agents in the Tribal Areas to mobilize support among tribal leaders. In addition, intelligence resources are also being sent in to monitor how people plan to vote and ensure the pro-Pakistani numbers increase.”
-They bought it! (90 days later, event “Pakistan Announces Pashtunistan Rejected in Referendum”)
Afghanistan Appreciates, but Rejects Our Offer (Pakistan event)
“The Afghan government informed us they did not approve of the proposal to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan in the Tribal Areas. Afghanistan would want such a vote to incorporate all of Pashtunistan and ideally be conducted through a neutral third party. Regardless, Afghanistan did mention they appreciated the gesture as a positive movement and hoped we would soon accept the need for a comprehensive referendum in the future. Although our proposal was rejected, we did improve relations as our offer caused further divisions within the hardliner faction in Kabul, which only strengthens the position of those pushing for peace.”
-Oh well (Pakistan-Afghanistan relations improved)
Pakistan Announces Pashtunistan Rejected in Referendum (Pakistan/Afghanistan event)
“The long-awaited results from a recent referendum in the Pakistan Tribal Areas on whether its people wished to join Afghanistan as part of Pashtunistan or remain in Pakistan arrived yesterday. The people voted to stay in Pakistan. The Pakistan government praised the tribal people for their dedication and devotion to the nation. The result comes amid accusations that Pakistani officials offered incentives for tribal leaders to endorse voting for Pakistan and reports that residents who travelled between Pakistan and Afghanistan were considered ineligible to vote. Perhaps the biggest criticism was the arrival of many ballots from Pathans in the armed forces who claimed to be from the Tribal Areas. Pakistan is satisfied with the vote and its government claims it had never doubted the loyalty of its people. The reaction from Afghanistan will likely come soon.”
-Pakisitan Zindabad (Pakistan gains stability, event “Afghanistan Denounces the Results” in 2 days) 
Afghanistan Denounces the Results (Pakistan/Afghanistan event)
“Kabul released a blistering statement condemning the recent referendum held in the Pakistan Tribal Areas over if the residents wished to remain in Pakistan or join Afghanistan for Pashtunistan. A large majority voted to remain in Pakistan. However, the Afghan government contends widespread voter manipulation occurred in the weeks leading up to the vote. In addition the Pakistanis refused to count the votes of those who regularly traveled across the border, claiming it was unknown if they were permanent residents of the Pakistani Tribal Areas. With these issues, the Afghan government insists the results were illegitimate and they would not stop championing the cause of Pashtunistan for the millions of Pathans struggling under Pakistani occupation.”
-Relations cool (big drop Pakistan-Afghanistan relations)
Denounce Afghan Interference (Event from PAK_Denounce_Afghan_Interference)
“The Pakistan government, in an unusually scathing statement, denounced the government of Afghanistan for its constant interference in Pakistani affairs. They accuse the Afghans of seeking to start armed uprisings and spreading false claims in order to poison the relationship of Pakistan to its citizens along the border. The government noted it had its own capabilities and if the Afghans did not relent, Pakistan would soon have to bring them in line to teach them a lesson. It is clear that Pakistan is nearing a breaking point with Afghanistan.”
-We are strong (stability boost for Pakistan, relations with Afghanistan drops)
Pakistan Demand We Recognize Durand Line (Afghanistan event from PAK_Demand_Recognition_Of_Durand_Line)
“Continuing its recent shift towards hostility, the Pakistan government demanded Afghanistan recognize the Durand Line as the official border between both nations. The Pakistanis insisted Afghans stop living in a fanciful world and accept the reality on the ground. It noted Afghanistan accepted the border under the Raj and as Pakistan inherited those lands, it had to respect the border. This is an aggressive push by Pakistan and some fear they maybe looking at military options. Some in the government suggest we privately assure the Pakistanis we harbor no ambitions for their territory, but that we cannot publicly recognize the border at this moment. The hardliners in the government insist we denounce the Pakistani government for its bullying and reiterate our stance.”
-Privately Assure the Pakistanis (event “Afghanistan Privately Promises to Respect the Border”)
-Denounce Pakistan (event “Afghanistan Denounces Pakistan”)
Afghanistan Privately Promises to Respect the Border (Pakistan Event)
“The Afghan government dispatched an intermediary to inform our government that Afghanistan has heard our warnings. The intermediary insisted Afghanistan currently has no plots or desires to change the status quo along the border. They have also promised to tone down some of the Pashtunistan propaganda and will endeavor to keep relations as cordial as possible. In exchange they have asked us to reign in the hostile commentary and keep channels open. Our government will accept this statement and soon tone down the rhetoric, we have achieved our objective of using a strong posture to push the Afghans towards peace.”
-Excellent (big boost Pakistan-Afghanistan relations)
Afghanistan Denounces Pakistan (Pakistan event)
“The Afghan government defiantly condemned our recent statements and reiterated their claims to Pashtunistan. The Afghan government insists it is on a pure and noble mission and they will not be browbeaten by any foreign power. It appears our hardline approach has not led the Afghans to realize their constant hostility benefits no one. Indeed, relations have only worsened, and we must remain vigilant on the western border. The Pakistan Army however, has a proposal on how to firmly show Afghanistan the seriousness of our position and save the situation to our favor.”
-Damn it (Pakistan-Afghanistan relations big drop, new decision “Start Border War with Afghanistan”)
Decision Afghan Border War 
Description for “Start Border War with Afghanistan”
“The Afghan government continues to bring up Pashtunistan and threatens the stability of Pakistan. A bold plan from GHQ calls for our forces to engage in a border conflict with the Afghans. Once we defeat the Afghan forces on the border, their government will realize the gravity of the situation and come to their senses.”
-Start the fighting (border war between Pakistan-Afghanistan)
Pakistan Victorious, Afghanistan in Panic
“The recent border war between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended in a victory for Pakistani forces. Pakistani forces recently launched operations against Afghan forces on the border. Many analysts thought the Pakistanis would have the upper hand in the conflict and they were proved right. News of the military defeat on the border led to panic in Kabul as some feared the Pakistani forces may push deeper into the country. However, the Pakistani government instead halted, claiming its forces had delivered a befitting reply to years of Afghan harassment. Sources in Kabul indicate the Pakistanis managed to extract a promise of non-aggression from the Afghan government for at least five years. The Pakistan Army is enjoying public demonstrations in its honor across major Pakistani cities in appreciation for its successful operations.”
-Big victory (Afghanistan-Pakistan non-aggression pact for 5 years, Pakistan gains 3 year spirit “Defeat Afghans in Border War” stability boost, increase in morale, small increase in production/efficiency, Afghanistan gains 3 year spirit “Pakistan Wins Border War” which drops stability, small reduction in morale as well as production/efficiency)
Afghan Forces Halt Pakistani Aggression
“The recent border war between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended in victory for the Afghan Army. Pakistani forces had started the fighting after launching attacks on Afghan troops on the border. Many analysts thought the Pakistanis would have the upper hand, but this proved a faulty assumption. The details are not clear, but it appears the Pakistan military had either underestimated the Afghans or overestimated themselves. Afghan forces not only drove back the Pakistanis but are currently occupying some territory over the border, calling it liberated land of Pashtunistan. With warnings from Delhi, the Pakistan government is incapable of expanding the conflict and must live with the stinging consequences of this failed campaign. In Kabul there is a feeling of joy and optimism that the dream of Pashtunistan is far from a fantasy.”
-Surprising development (Pakistan cedes one of its areas by the border, don’t know which one yet, Pakistan gains 3 year spirit “Afghans Win Border War” which drops stability, small reduction in morale as well as production/efficiency. Afghanistan gains 3 year spirit “Pakistan Border War Victory” stability boost, increase in morale, small increase in production/efficiency)

Pakistan Asks for Talks (Afghanistan event) (comes from focus PAK_Hold_Talks_With_Afghan_Government)
“The Pakistani Ambassador delivered a message from President Ayub Khan inviting a delegation to hold talks in Pakistan. The message was friendly and it appears the Pakistanis are looking to mend ties. However, we cannot let them lull us into a position where we abandon our brothers across the border. Some of the advisors suggest we reject the invitation as words cannot solve our problems. However, others argue we should accept the invitation, to at least see their stance and maybe improve conditions on the border to our advantage.”
-Send delegation (leads to event Afghanistan Sending High-level Delegation in 2 days)
-Decline the invitation (leads to event Afghans Refuse to Talk in 2 days)
Afghanistan Sending High-level Delegation (Pakistan event)
“Our efforts at reaching out to Afghanistan bore fruit as they have agreed to send a high-level delegation to hold talks with us. We can expect their arrival shortly and must consider the approach we wish to take for the talks. For President Ayub, an ethnic Pathan, he is keenly interested in stabilizing ties with Afghanistan and prevent unrest among the Pakistani Pathan population. If such a scenario occurred it could prove disastrous, especially with regards to ties with India. We can take a conciliatory approach and sign agreements to boost ties and cultural exchanges. Or we can take a hardline and call for Afghanistan to accept the Durand Line as the permanent border.”
-Offer to boost ties (Afghanistan gets Pakistan Proposes Options to Boost Ties in 2 days)

Pakistan Proposes Options to Boost Ties (Afghanistan Event)
“During talks held with the Pakistanis, they have offered a series of measures, including cultural exchanges that are meant to improve ties. The Pakistani offer is no doubt meant to normalize ties between our states. Increasing cultural ties would afford us to gain more intelligence and would reduce some of the tension in Kabul. However, accepting the initiative may confuse our own people and reduce their fervor for the Pashtunistan cause. We must decide what move would be best.”
-Accept the proposals (Pakistan gets Afghans Accept Efforts to Boost Ties in 2 days, Afghanistan gets 5 year spirit “Pakistan Détente” giving intelligence boost)
-Reject the proposals (Pakistan gets Afghans Decline Effort to Improve Relations in 2 days)
Pakistan Calls for Durand Line to be Made Permanent (Afghanistan event)
“In a jarring meeting with the Pakistanis, they have stated their desire for us to accept the Durand Line as the permanent border. As this stands against the key pillar of our foreign policy, our delegation immediately refused. It appeared the talks were about to end abruptly, however, the Pakistanis offered a compromise. They stated if we could give private assurances that we can accept the Durand Line that would be enough for them. We can accept this compromise, or reject it outright and end the talks.”
-Accept the Compromise (Pakistan gets event Afghanistan Agrees to not Bring up Durand Line in 2 days)
-Reject Proposal (Pakistan gets event Afghanistan Rejects Durand Line in 2 days)
Afghans Refuse to Talk (Pakistan event)
“President Ayub received news that the Afghan government has rebuffed our invitation to hold talks. This is a troubling developments and indicates they are bent on trying to change the status quo. The Afghans are no doubt harboring dangerous designs and we must remain vigilant on the border. Regardless, the military insists the Afghan threat is minimal and can be easily monitored or contained. President Ayub will have to accept this effort has failed.”
-Oh well (Pakistan-Afghan relations drop)
Afghans Accept Efforts to Boost Ties (Pakistan event)
“The Afghans proved very receptive to our proposals on normalizing ties and have accepted. They only asked for minor adjustments meant to improve travel for Afghans with relatives in Pakistan. President Ayub enthusiastically signed the agreements and released a statement celebrating what he termed the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Afghan government released its own, more muted statement approving of the agreement, stating it will help facilitate the reunion of Afghans with their families across the border.”
-Wonderful news (big boost in Pakistan-Afghan relations)
Afghans Decline Effort to Improve Relations (Pakistan event)
“The Afghan delegation stated they could not in good conscious accept our generous proposals for normalizing ties. They insisted as long as we continued to deny Pathans the right for Pashtunistan, they could not attempt to mend ties. We informed them that there was nothing left to discuss then. The talks thus concluded and the Afghans returned to Kabul. We released a statement expressing our disappointment with the failure to achieve a breakthrough. The Afghans released their own statement accusing us of using the talks as a means to gain a propaganda victory. President Ayub is bitterly disappointed with the outcome.”
-At least we tried (Pakistan-Afghanistan ties drop)
Afghanistan Rejects Durand Line (Pakistan event)
“The Afghan delegation reiterated that the Durand Line was not on the table. They added that there did not appear to be anything left to discuss and abruptly ended the talks to return home. For President Ayub Khan this marks a major setback in his efforts to establish a calm western border. The Pakistani government released a statement regretting the talks could not achieve a meaningful breakthrough. The Afghan government released its own terse statement accusing Pakistan of using the talks as means to permanently deny the right of Pashtunistan to the Pathan people.
-At least we tried (big drop in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties)
Afghanistan Agrees to not Bring up Durand Line (Pakistan event)
“The Afghan delegation returned and stated that they were willing to give private assurances regarding the Durand Line.

The Afghan delegation soon returned back to Kabul. The Pakistani government released a statement calling the talks a positive step and would hopefully lead to a future of positive ties.

PAK_Direct_Military_To_Establish_Camps
"The unprecedented Afghan refugee presence is overwhelming local authorities and causing conflict in our border cities. GHQ has tasked the local corps commander to take control of the situation. Army engineers plan on establishing refugee camps outside Peshawar and other towns. The Army will work closely with civil servants to establish effective communication between the refugees and our government. The refugees are being led by their traditional tribal elders, as such, we plan on distributing aid directly to these elders and let them distribute it to families. The Army Medical Corps, working with foreign aid organizations plan on establishing field hospitals as well. This will help lessen the social tensions caused by the refugees and show our brotherly commitment to aiding the Afghan people."

PAK_Establish_ISI_Pipleline
"After intense analysis, the ISI has identified the major rebel groups willing and capable of launching operations against the Soviet backed puppet regime. Military aid to the rebels from outside sources will be strictly controlled by the ISI, who will distribute the arms to the most effective groups. Those groups which lack the will to engage in armed struggle will not receive arms or cash. Brigadier Mohamad Yousaf, the recently appointed head of the Afghan Bureau, is the point man for this arms pipeline. Arms imported to Karachi are to be transported with civilian vehicles to Mujahideen camps being established near the border."
