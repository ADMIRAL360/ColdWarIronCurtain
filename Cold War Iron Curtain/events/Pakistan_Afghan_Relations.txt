#1970s
PAK_Direct_Military_To_Establish_Camps
"The unprecedented Afghan refugee presence is overwhelming local authorities and causing conflict in our border cities. GHQ has tasked the local corps commander to take control of the situation. Army engineers plan on establishing refugee camps outside Peshawar and other towns. The Army will work closely with civil servants to establish effective communication between the refugees and our government. The refugees are being led by their traditional tribal elders, as such, we plan on distributing aid directly to these elders and let them distribute it to families. The Army Medical Corps, working with foreign aid organizations plan on establishing field hospitals as well. This will help lessen the social tensions caused by the refugees and show our brotherly commitment to aiding the Afghan people."

PAK_Establish_ISI_Pipleline
"After intense analysis, the ISI has identified the major rebel groups willing and capable of launching operations against the Soviet backed puppet regime. Military aid to the rebels from outside sources will be strictly controlled by the ISI, who will distribute the arms to the most effective groups. Those groups which lack the will to engage in armed struggle will not receive arms or cash. Brigadier Mohamad Yousaf, the recently appointed head of the Afghan Bureau, is the point man for this arms pipeline. Arms imported to Karachi are to be transported with civilian vehicles to Mujahideen camps being established near the border."
