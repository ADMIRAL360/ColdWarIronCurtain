Disarming Bengali Troops
-Rats (after Rise of Mukti Bahini fires, the Mukti Bahini Ranks Swell event will come later, idk if it is possible but maybe remove 2 paramilitary brigades in east Pakistan, if it is not feasible than no need)

Some Bengali Defections
-Good news (after Rise of Mukti Bahini fires, the Defectors Join Mukti Bahini event will come later)

Rise of Mukti Bahini (this launches 45 days after Operation Searchlight, this will open that portion of tree)
-We will deal with these miscreants (launches an insurgency, Mukti Bahini vs Pakistan, ideally we want this to last at least two years, depending on pre-requisites either Mukti Bahini Ranks Swell or Defectors Join Mukti Bahini fires next)

Mukti Bahini Ranks Swell (if Disarming Bengali Troops fired)
-Damn it (Mukti Bahini insurgency should gain good amount of insurgency points)

Defectors Join Mukti Bahini (if Some Bengali Defections fired)
-Keep them in line (Mukti Bahini should gain some insurgency points)

Expand Martial Law Courts (event from PAK_Expand_Martial_Law_Regime)
-Good (Pakistan gain some insurgency points)

Establish Mujahid Forces (event from PAK_Establish_Mujahid_Forces)
-Welcome the Mujahid Forces (either gives manpower and some insurgency points for Pakistan or add 4-6 brigade sized units of basically just militia, the Mujahid Forces were essentially motivated but poorly trained, lightly armed fighters who held territory as the Army conducted counter insurgency operations)

Reports of Bengali Massacres (should fire maybe a month or two after Establish Mujahid Forces)
-Not a good look (Pakistan gets spirit for 3 years "International Condemnation over Bengalis" trade relations with US/UK/Fra/India/USSR hurt, decrease in stability, a month later event Reports of Bihari Massacres)

Reports of Bihari Massacres
-Why we fight (Pakistan gets spirit for six months "Protecting Biharis" boost in morale)

Empower Pakistani Loyalists (event from PAK_Empower_Pakistani_Loyalists)
-For the motherland (Pakistan gains insurgency points)

Religious Minorities Fleeing East Pakistan (event from PAK_Religious_Minority_Exodus)
-Media bias (modify the spirit "International Condemnation over Bengalis" making everything worse, in a couple weeks fire the event "Bengalis Fleeing East Pakistan" for India)

Bengalis Fleeing East Pakistan (Indian event)
-The Costs are High (India gets spirit for 3 years "Bengali Refugee Crisis" increase construction for civ/mil/office/infra to simulate financial resources being diverted to deal with the refugees)

Pakistan Air Force Proposal (event from PAK_PAF_Proposal)
-Launch the air strike (leads to event "Surprise Pakistani Air Strikes!" for India like a week later)
-Hold off and wait for India to act (Pakistan cannot start the 1971 War basically)

Surprise Pakistani Air Strikes (Indian event)
-So it is war (Indo-Pakistan War starts (Pakistan-India at war) for India starts event "Liberation War Begins", immediately launches event for Pakistan "Airstrike Report")

Airstrike Report (Pakistan)
-Pakistan Zindabad (completes focus PAK_New_Indo_Pak_War, launches event "Pakistan Attacks Indian Airfields")

Pakistan Attacks Indian Airfields (global event)
-Hopefully we will have peace soon
